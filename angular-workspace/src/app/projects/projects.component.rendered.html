<h2 id="project-theme">Project Theme</h2>
<p>As a focus for Winter 2020, we asked students to explore <strong>self-tracking and everyday interaction with personal intelligences</strong>.</p>
<p>People have long sought to better understand themselves, but continuing technology advances enable new approaches.
Students examined problems people encounter in gathering and gaining value from personal data,
then explored how a combination of design and machine intelligence can
help go beyond simple data fetishes to help people in using personal data as part of reaching their goals.</p>

<h3 id="problem-overview">Problem Overview</h3>
<p>Alcohol is ubiquitous throughout cultural spaces. It is a source of entertainment, but also of danger, expenses, and health complications. Alcohol's association with forgetting responsibilities makes mechanisms of self-moderation unpopular. To date, none have been adopted at scale. Yet, habitual drinking, uncertain limits, and overspending remain a prevalent issue.</p>
<p>Many existing tools fall into the pattern of &quot;data-fetishism&quot;. The drinker experiences novel amusement toward trends in their consumption before ultimately discarding the app. Others are too heavy-handed, requiring one to drag out their phone to record statistics. Our goal is to approach this problem from an angle that encourages and rewards habits of mindful consumption while recognizing one's existing goals and social contexts.</p>
<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<h4 id="methods">Methods</h4>
<p>We conducted semi-structured interviews with college students who frequently consume alcohol and funds while out with friends. We chose interviews due to the complication of a contextual inquiry on inebriated individuals. College students were our primary population of interest due to their frequent involvement in drinking, socialization, and the purchase of alcohol while on a limited budget.</p>
<h4 id="goals">Goals</h4>
<p>Our interview prompts started out broad and on the explorative side and grew to be more focused around identifying the topics below.</p>
<ul>
<li>People’s motivations for self regulation.</li>
<li>Sources of frustration in current moderation and tracking methods.</li>
<li>Methods tried before by them or their friends.</li>
<li>Challenges that come with different environments in which they consume alcohol.</li>
<li>Confidence in their general knowledge about alcohol.</li>
<li>Personal signs that they or their friends have consumed too much.</li>
<li>Actions that they would like to have access to or find intriguing but can not perform right now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the initial interviews were less effective in identifying a final design but helped us iterate on our interview scripts and create specific questions that we needed for making an informed choice for our final design. Indications that occasional binge drinking was intentional and desirable to social drinkers led us to refocus on participants experiences around the intersection of drinking and spending.</p>
<h4 id="participants">Participants</h4>
<p>We tried to choose participants that are still in college and have a decent amount of drinking experience. We also tried to have diversity in gender to and their majors. Finally we also interviewed a bartender to get the insight from the other side. For the bartender interview a different custom script was used. Overall during our research we ended up conducting interviews with six participants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asian female. Majoring in Informatics. Drinks 1 - 5 times a week.</li>
<li>Asian male. 21 years old. Majoring in HCD. Drinks once a month.</li>
<li>Asian male. 21 years old. Majoring in CS. Drinks once a week.</li>
<li>White male. 22 years old. Majoring in Physics. Drinks 1 - 2 times a week.</li>
<li>Asian female. 19 years old. Majoring in Communications. Drinks a couple times a month.</li>
<li>Asian female. 21 years old. Works as a bartender.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="results-themes">Results &amp; Themes</h3>
<p><strong>”Ballpark” tracking methods are enjoyed for their simplicity</strong></p>
<p>Many participants tracked the amount of drinks they’ve had in their head, or on their arm with a marker. The bartender mentioned receipts being used by customers to keep a tally of drinks. Most participants lacked motivation to comprehensively log drinks due to inconvenience and risk of being labeled as “no fun”. Participants were resistant to the idea of pulling out their phone to track drinks, but saw the social impact of tracking amongst their friends as a non-issue. In fact, some participants perceived counting their drinks as a mechanism to show that you can handle a lot of alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>Drinkers are aware of short-term risks, but they sometimes ignore what they know</strong></p>
<p>Participants shared concerns about “blacking-out” and personal safety. One participant shared a salient memory of a friend’s emergency room visit after alcohol poisoning. The sentiment that <em>“It’s rarely worth it to get that drunk”</em> recognizes the dangers of overconsumption, but this line between <em>“a good amount drunk”</em> and <em>“too much”</em> seemed like something participants relied on past experience and physical sensation to gauge.</p>
<p><strong>Social drinkers distribute their drinking across locations</strong></p>
<p>Participants described moving locations frequently during nights out with their friends. One participant explained, <em>“Last Saturday, two days ago. I pregamed here and went out to a bar and then a club. I was with a group of friends.”</em>. This notion of “pre-gaming” and “kick-backs” was echoed throughout responses, and indicates that consecutive instances of drinking and spending may not always be co-located. Furthermore, the vendor of the alcohol was often a friend rather than a cashier.</p>
<p><strong>Nights out are expensive, and can involve a unanticipated expenses</strong></p>
<p>Many participants expressed difficulties regulating spending, with drinks, food, and ride-share services. Many of them offered estimation of their expenses, with the three highest spending $50, $60, and $80 per night. For frequent drinkers, this is a significant life expense that is difficult to trace due to the distribution of expenses across varying locations and type of purchase. Some participants attempted to set personal allowances, but had varying success in sticking to their goals. Another participant was comfortable being less vigilant <em>”I just swipe my card and I don’t keep track. I just sign it and I’m good to go</em>”.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>With our results in mind we carefully examined what was the current experience for our participants and what they were interested and motivated in pursuing. This led us to boil the possible achievable tasks to the ones listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Preventing overspending on alcohol and food on a night out.</strong>
We have found that monetary impact of drinking is the most appealing motivation factor for attempting to moderate yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knowing the total amount you spend on a night out.</strong>
While similar in theme to previous task, many participants expressed concerns in aggressive moderation tactics and would rather just make their own conclusions based on the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Selecting drinks to your taste, budget, and tolerance level.</strong>
Many participants were not very well informed in how much alcohol they were consuming and showed interest in personalized assistance for nights out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keeping track of how many drinks you have had.</strong>
While the task itself is fairly straightforward there are many challenges in doing this effectively and unobtrusively on a smart device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Having emergency contacts readily available for others to help.</strong>
Being able to effectively help your friends and allow others to help you is one of the only aspects of consuming too much that our participants took seriously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notifying someone when you’re in an uncomfortable situation.</strong>
Outside of just having the information readily available, being able to easily send an SOS like message to an emergency contact when you are out drinking is a feature often requested by our participants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proposal-sketches">Proposal Sketches</h3>
<p>There are three design spaces that we decided to explore. Each attempts to provide a solution to a slightly different subset of tasks and approaches the general problem of moderation from a novel angle.</p>
<h4 id="mobile-application">Mobile Application</h4>
<p>The main goal of the mobile application is to allow for a clear way to set and track spending goals. This design approaches the task by providing an insightful and feature full application that can be used before and after a night out to track your progress. There also extra features that allow you to reach out to an emergency contact for yourself or your friends.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/mobile_app_design.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 400px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/mobile_app_design_2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 400px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="smart-watch-application">Smart Watch Application</h4>
<p>The smart watch design attempts to reuse existing hardware to provide a smarter solution for counting your drinks. Most of the interactions would happen on the actual watch face itself. While the amount of information displayed is much more limited, the ability to track and review the information in a convenient way differentiates this design from others.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/smart_watch_app_design.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="smart-bracelet">Smart Bracelet</h4>
<p>A device specifically designed to be able to count your drinks allows for a more focused solution. While this design presents the most limited amount of information compared to others, it also provides both a subtler way to track and a combination of visual and tactile way of presenting the count of drinks consumed.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/smart_bracelet_design.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="selected-design">Selected Design</h3>
<p>We chose to pursue a design that incorporates both a smart watch and a phone app. This allows us to both keep count of drinks consumed and track spending in an effective manner.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/selected_design.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>During our research, many participants expressed disinterest in moderation techniques that required extensive time and attention. Many were also reluctant to buy any new hardware for alcohol moderation due to doubt in effectiveness and convenience of any extra devices. They did display interest in something that integrates with their existing devices, such as a smart watch. This motivated us to pick a design that would take advantage of the existing smartwatch hardware and provide the convenience of your wrist while still backing it up with a full-fledged mobile app. Unlike other designs, it lends us the opportunity to project a streamlined interface to the wearer that is accessible during the act of drinking, while reserving the more complicated, descriptive tasks like reviewing your progress or adjusting your goals for the phone application. We believe physically separating the modes of goal-limited drinking and goal-setting could prevent social drinkers from feeling intruded on during their nights out, while still retaining the tools necessary to subtly keep themselves accountable. In our design we chose to target the tasks of keeping track of how much you drank and knowing the total amount you spent on a night out. These two tasks aligned the best with the core desires that our participants displayed. The information gathered during tracking your drinks and your spending is also an essential prerequisite for allowing the user to try and tackle the other tasks that we considered such as preventing overspending or reaching out to an emergency contact when someone over-consumes. Rather than imposing one specific goal, such as complete sobriety, our aim is to provide the wearer with an interface through which to set goals like saving money, learning limits, and cutting back on alcohol ahead-of-time. Then, the wearer can measure and evaluate their performance in comparison to those goals.</p>
<h4 id="storyboard-1">Storyboard 1</h4>
<p>Counting drinks effectively on a night out is very helpful in allowing a person to identify that they should stop. Let us illustrate it by following our hero Otis through a series of events. Otis and his friends are out at a bar and one person suggests doing another round of drinks. Otis habitually checks his watch and realizes that he has consumed more than he thought. Based on this information he decides to take a pass and enjoys the rest of his night out, confident in his choice.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/storyboard_1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="storyboard-2">Storyboard 2</h4>
<p>Realizing that you have spent too much can also serve as a great trigger to reconsider your actions. This time Otis is out at a club and he is having a great time. He offers to purchase drinks for his friends and continues to get drinks for some strangers. Yet after seeing how much he has spent he starts worrying about paying for his rent and even paying for his next meal. He decides to stop his spending for the night, feeling like he is making an informed choice.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem-prioritizing-sleep">The Problem: Prioritizing Sleep</h3>
<p>Sleep is a critical part of growth and development. It is surprising, then, that sleep is so often neglected by
college students. As the lives of students become more crowded and complex, where does sleep fit in? Between
studies, work, extracurricular activities, and social events, many students fail to find the time to do everything
and end up sacrificing sleep as a result. Our group wants to examine sleeping habits of adolescents, focusing on
this central question:</p>
<p><strong>How do we facilitate proper sleeping habits for those that can sleep earlier but won't?</strong></p>
<p>Our solution, a smart pillow, uses tracking to empower users and inform them on ways to improve their sleeping habits.
In our design process, we determined that our solution needed to inform users on the effects of a healthy sleep
schedule and furthermore needed to encourage healthier sleep. A smart pillow allows us to gather the data necessary
and a companion app gave us the ability to educate users on sleeping habits more effectively. Here, we will describe
the evolution of our design and how we were able to reach a smart pillow.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals">Design Research Goals:</h3>
<p>To learn about sleeping habits of our target demographic, we chose three main research methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>A questionnaire to gauge general trends</li>
<li>A diary study to gain in depth insights on sleeping habits of individual students</li>
<li>An expert interview to learn about the science of sleep and how it affects our demographic</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="questionnaire">Questionnaire</h4>
<p>Our questionnaire was designed specifically with the intention of gaining large scale insights into the sleeping habits
of our target demographic: college-aged adolescents. In order to accomplish this, we crafted questions to be simple
and unintrusive. The survey itself was anonymous and short, allowing us to more effectively gather responses from
a wide range of people. The survey would inform us on the needs of the general population we were dealing with and
how to best tackle our problem. Questions covered demographic information, sleep routine, fatigue, and sleep disorders.
The variety in questions would give us a broad data set that we could draw key insights from.</p>
<h4 id="diary-study">Diary Study</h4>
<p>We chose to do a diary study to complement the questionnaire. The questionnaire enabled us to find a large quantity
of research participants. However, we felt the need to go more in depth with our research to find out what specific
parts of a sleep routine were important to study. We attempted to study this by doing a diary study. Our main goal
throughout the process was to identify what parts of a person's life most affected sleep. We asked participants to
fill out a detailed journal for approximately 4 days, including information about daily routine, bedtime rituals,
sleep quality, and mood or fatigue. The diaries went much farther in depth to help us find out more about the factors
affecting a person's sleep.</p>
<h4 id="expert-interview">Expert Interview</h4>
<p>For our expert interview, we reached out to several people regarding an interview.
Due to limited time availability of such experts, we were able to successfully arrange one interview.
This expert sleep researcher's work and experience perfectly fit our project's scope.
We met with her after the majority of our research had concluded (due to availability constraints).
She was a fantastic resource and we felt compelled to talk to her.
The focus of our questions was mainly sleep and its relationship with adolescent growth and development.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results">Design Research Results:</h3>
<h4 id="questionnaire-2">Questionnaire</h4>
<p>The questionnaire we distributed received 48 responses. The participants came from a variety of majors and had class
standings ranging from freshmen to PhD students. We gained many insights from the surveys. 75% of students reported
sleeping after 12am on weekdays, 85% of people reported sleeping after 12am on weekends, and most importantly, <strong>69%</strong>
of participants revealed that they had attempted to change their sleeping habits but failed. We saw there was a clear
need for tracking to aide one's ability to sleep and to encourage our population to prioritize sleep more than they
currently are. More specifically, we learned that <strong>effects of sleep deprivation varied greatly within the population of college students</strong>.
This meant that our design would need to be universal, learning about the user then adjusting to the individual.
Additionally, we found that <strong>effective sleep routines remained consistent</strong>. By this we mean that consistency of
bedtime in addition to duration of sleep improved mood and fatigue by a lot.</p>
<h4 id="diary-study-2">Diary Study</h4>
<p>In our diary study, we had six participants journal for about four days. Reading through the information given to us
gave us insight into how to design our solution. The first insight we gained from reading through our journals was how
<strong>events throughout the entire day affected sleep quality</strong>. We saw that many participants indicated lower quality of sleep
on days that were negative or sad. The activities or schedule of a person can greatly influence their sleep, even if said
activites took place in the middle of the day. The relationship also worked in the other direction as we had observed many people
experiencing worse attittude on days where they had gotten minimal sleep the night before. The next insight we found
was the <strong>importance of sleep environment</strong>. Each person's environment was different and we found that
<strong>many factors contributing to sleep deprivation or poor sleep quality were controllable</strong>. Things that are known to have a huge effect
on sleep that we found affected participants in our diary study were light and noise, specifically blue light.
Participants had noted that blue light from devices often played a huge role in their sleep loss.</p>
<h4 id="expert-interview-2">Expert Interview</h4>
<p>Our interview with the expert sleep researcher yielded a plethora of information to consider in our design. We prepared a series of
questions beforehand and learned a lot about her work and research. Because this was after our checkpoint was due,
we had time to discuss our findings from the questionnaire and diary study. Our conversation yielded a
few key insights. She discussed with us
the <strong>importance of data</strong> and how it could be used to improve people's sleep and by consequence the rest of their lives.
We additionally discussed details of sleep and how it affects college students in particular. An extremely interesting part
of the interview revolved around <strong>circadian rhythm and how it varies within our population</strong>. It further changed our
thinking about sleep habits. We knew the solution we came up with would need to be universal and able to accommodate
a variety of students' needs. Overall the interview was fun and informative. We drew from the interview when designing
the gamification of our app and when thinking about how to best meet the needs of the diverse population.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>We identify the following six tasks to be important to our design:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Creating social progress trackers shared between users as a social experience to encourage better sleep routines
and accountability</p>
<p>This idea originated as a sleep competition, but over the course of our research, we redefined it to be a social
progress tracker. The incentive to sleep is not very strong for many people, so we want to provide some kind of
progress tracker that not only displays one's data for their own growth, but also shares it to encourage others
to follow their good example. Our goal with this task is not only to share good practices, but also to challenge
existing notions of sleep as a low priority. We want a way to encourage people to sleep more and to move away from
a culture that tolerates or even celebrates prioritizing other responsibilities over sleep and personal well-being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Displaying clear and straightforward data regarding their sleep routine and physical health for people</p>
<p>Our solution needs to be personal, helping users based on their specific needs. Because of this, a major part of
our approach is centered on showing people their own data so they can make decisions about how to best improve their
sleep. Our design needed to help the user figure out what works best for them instead of basing decisions off of
generalized data. Part of that is communicating sleep data in a way that's simple and concise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivating a relaxed mindset and environment for better sleep</p>
<p>Our research showed that the environment a person sleeps in has a major effect on their sleep patterns. Things
such as light, noise, and temperature should be taken into account by our design. More generally, our design
needed to inform the user on what external factors were in their control that could be affecting their sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging people to reconsider how they prioritize sleep</p>
<p>One of the main focuses of our project from the start was encouraging people to reprioritize sleep. For students
with many major responsibilities, sleep is often a low priority. When faced with high pressure from deadlines,
people will often stay up late to finish something. Our design should discourage this by encouraging users to
reexamine their priorities and plan ahead to prevent situations occurring where they are forced to stay up late.
Sleep and self-care should be encouraged and prioritized above school, work, or other responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helping people adapt a balanced daily schedule to avoid conflicting with their sleep routine/circadian rhythm</p>
<p>As we discovered from our interview with an expert sleep researcher, sleep can differ greatly among individuals and the most
challenging group to cater to would be those whose sleep schedules didn't align with their day-to-day responsibilities.
Some people experience the most focus and productivity at night, for instance, and consequently struggle to find a
sleep schedule that accommodates their work or school. One of our tasks is to help people like this by finding
a way to eliminate or at least mitigate the difficulties associated with their sleep routine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Informing people how sleep can help accomplish their goals</p>
<p>Our final goal is to teach people how sleep can help them accomplish their goals. It isn't uncommon for people to
ignore sleep's effects on their lives. People can sometimes see sleep as a natural part of their routine and don't
give any further consideration to its improvement. People don't think about how getting more sleep can help one's
entire life and instead treat it as wasted time. In reality, sleep is almost like an investment. The time spent
sleeping isn't wasted. In fact, sleep deprivation is linked to several health conditions and poorer performance in
school or work. We want our solution to inform people of this and change the attitude towards sleep to be more
positive, making it a necessity instead of a chore.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proposed-designs">Proposed Designs</h3>
<h4 id="smart-ring-bracelet">Smart Ring/Bracelet</h4>
<p>Our first design was a smart ring or bracelet. The idea was to have a wearable device that would track vital information
during sleep. The device could be used as an alarm and could be used without a phone or computer. The smart ring would
have a companion app that focused primarily on communicating data to the user, but would be out of the way to discourage
phone use before bed.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/smartring.png" alt="smart ring" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; border: 2px solid black; box-shadow: 5px 5px #555" /></p>
<h4 id="alarm-clock">Alarm Clock</h4>
<p>Our second design was an alarm clock. An alarm clock was a natural choice of form since it is already a part of many people's
routines. It would be a convenient and subtle way to make it easy for people to gather data. Unlike our other approaches, an
alarm clock would not require a companion app. Instead it could track data and provide insights to the user itself without
having to connect to a device or the internet. The form factor allowed for a wide array of sensors for the environment a
person sleeps in, but couldn't truly track information about the user themselves without manual input. In addition, the approach
using a device that worked independently of a computer or internet allowed for greater privacy and security of data.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/alarmclock.png" alt="alarm clock" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; border: 2px solid black; box-shadow: 5px 5px #555" /></p>
<h4 id="smart-pillow">Smart Pillow</h4>
<p>Our final design was a smart pillow. This design contrasted with our other approaches because it was already a part of most
people's sleep, and we thought if we could get the cost low enough, it would be an easier sell because of that. The pillow
is primarily used to track data. Using flexible sensors and memory foam we wanted to gather data on factors relating to sleep.
A companion app could be used to visualize and share this data. Additionally, the pillow could house a speaker, a small motor,
or even a heater to get a desired sleeping environment.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/pillowapp.png" alt="pillow" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; border: 2px solid black; box-shadow: 5px 5px #555" /></p>
<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards</h3>
<p>Our selected design is the smart pillow. We chose the smart pillow because this design would allow for accurate and
thorough data collection while still remaining convenient for our users. It would therefore be the best way to engage
our target audience. If we are able to maintain a low cost relative to normal pillows, we believe this design will be
the best and easiest to get college students to adopt.</p>
<h4 id="storyboard-1">Storyboard 1:</h4>
<p>Our first scenario involves the social progress tracker. It is used as an extrinsic motivation for a healthy sleep
routine. A person can see other people's progress and has a character that models their own health. Having such
data motivates our user to finish his work and sleep earlier.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/storyboard1.jpg" alt="storyboard 1" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin: auto; border: 2px solid black; box-shadow: 5px 5px #555" /></p>
<h4 id="storyboard-2">Storyboard 2:</h4>
<p>Our second scenario describes Richard, who struggles to sleep due to his obsession with his phone. It demonstrates
how a smart pillow can help a user gather data and help them go to sleep without the necessity of a phone.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/storyboard2.png" alt="storyboard 2" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin: auto; border: 2px solid black; box-shadow: 5px 5px #555" /></p>

TODO: It would be nice to have a place to put their tagline
Helping dogs maintain a healthy weight
--> 
<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview</h3>
<p>The problem we are addressing is obesity in dogs. We are seeking ways to help dog owners help their pets lose enough weight to be considered healthy or maintain their already healthy weight. Our solution is a smart dog collar and app combination that tracks when and where a dog eats, as well as tracking information associated with exercise and calorie consumption. Tracking these data points will help give owners enough information to be able to make informed decisions to help keep their pets healthy.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants</h3>
<h4 id="design-focus-primary-need-for-additional-understanding">Design Focus &amp; Primary Need for Additional Understanding</h4>
<p>Our initial focus has remained the same throughout our project - helping dog owners address their dogs’ weight. The primary things we needed to understand were the underlying causes for dog obesity and what helped perpetuate the weight issues. We felt that addressing these things would be the key to solving the issue.</p>
<h4 id="design-method-and-participants">Design Method and Participants</h4>
<p>To better understand the issue, we hoped to get information straight from the professionals. Our initial outreach and search for participants included veterinarians local to the Seattle area. The idea was that a veterinarian would know best how to address obesity within animals. We hoped to perform contextual inquiry, following around the veterinarians throughout their day. Unfortunately, due to liability issues and non-disclosure agreements, we were unable to get access to any veterinarians.</p>
<p>We proceeded to pivot entirely away from veterinarians, and more towards the dog owners themselves, using primarily semi-structured interviews to interview participants. The questions generally consisted of inquiries into their daily lives, what they considered healthy, their current actions to address their issues, and what information they wished they could have. In the case of some participants, we followed them throughout their day as they cared for their pets. In total, we interviewed 3 dog owners, a foster dog parent, and a professional dog walker.</p>
<p>While we wanted to get information regarding how to treat pet obesity from veterinarians, by pivoting to the owners themselves, our design goals solidified more towards helping dog owners do what they already do to address their pets’ obesity rather than starting from a blank canvas.</p>

<p>Over the course of all the interviews, two themes stood out. The source of a dog’s calorie intake was the most prominent factor that our interviewees mentioned. This ended up influencing our design the greatest.</p>
<h4 id="food-sources-and-overeating">Food Sources and Overeating</h4>
<p>The biggest insight we developed was around the diet of the pet. We found that many owners were having trouble tracking every source of food given to their dogs. One of the participants we interviewed had two dogs. Their problem was unique in that one dog would eat their full meal when it was served to them, while the other preferred to eat a little at a time throughout the day. This ended up creating a problem where the one dog would end up eating their food, and then some of the other dog’s food. Another participant that we interviewed, Julie, also had a dog that steals food from the bowls of other dogs.</p>
<p>Another common theme we heard from multiple participants was how hard it was for them to say no to their dogs. People are so emotionally invested in their dogs that one owner said,  “it was hard to say no to his puppy-dog eyes.” This same owner often found out that his extended family was giving his overweight dog treats even when he asked them not to.  This correlated directly with the opinions of the professional dog walker: “Owners love their dogs so much, they often feel like it is mean to withhold food in any way.”</p>
<p>Many owners mentioned that they wished they had a way to be able track when their dog eats, especially when the owner isn’t around. It became clear that if we wanted to effectively help owners deal with dog obesity, figuring out a way to automatically track when a dog is being fed was vital.</p>
<h4 id="exercise">Exercise</h4>
<p>When a human wants to lose weight, the phrase most often quoted is “diet and exercise”. This holds true for dogs as well. Although we chose to focus more on the diet side of that equation, we didn't want to completely ignore exercise.</p>
<p>What we found through our interviews was that pet owners never tracked how much exercise their pets received. One owner mentioned that his dog received,  “about an hour of play and another hour of walking”. When prompted for more details, he didn’t know and hadn’t recorded specifics. When we asked owners about duration and distance of exercise, most of the comments we received were vague. Based on this, we decided that focusing on automatic exercise tracking would provide an obvious benefit.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>Based on the interviews, we found that most participants don’t know how many calories their dogs consume daily and how much exercise their dogs get even though  these are the two most important factors influencing a dog’s weight. Therefore, we decide to create the six tasks below to help address the two problems, along with some other concerns that the participants have or lack of knowledge in.</p>
<h4 id="id-1-track-a-dog-s-weight-over-time-daily-weekly-and-monthly">1.  Track a dog’s weight over time, daily, weekly, and monthly</h4>
<p>The main goal of our design is to help dogs maintain a healthy weight. According to our interview responses, dog owners or dog caregivers, such as professional dog walkers, know that there would be slight fluctuations in dogs’ weights. They usually don’t notice their dogs gaining weight unless the weight gain can be visually seen. However, it is crucial to be aware of any weight gain in dogs in the early stage and start intervening immediately. Therefore, we found it helpful to track a dog’s weight over time (daily, weekly, and monthly). By doing this, it helps participants notice potential trends of weight gain, and also helps them to see how weight responds to variation in food intake and exercise.</p>
<h4 id="id-2-access-to-veterinarians-and-professional-help">2.  Access to veterinarians and professional help</h4>
<p>All of the dog owners we have interviewed expressed how busy they are dealing with things at school or work. They often didn’t have the time to get their dog regularly weighed. Also, they don’t have much experience and education in this area and preferred to consult veterinarians instead of making decisions on their own. Most of them talked about the desire for a quick and convenient way to consult veterinarians. Thus, we decided to add access to veterinarians as a task because a lot of dog owners rely on this means to determine whether their dogs are overweight.</p>
<h4 id="id-3-track-and-monitor-a-dog-s-exercise">3.  Track and monitor a dog’s exercise</h4>
<p>Exercise is one of the primary means for dogs to maintain a healthy weight. According to our interview responses,many owners don’t track or know how much their dogs are exercising. One of the dog owners we interviewed just let her dogs outside.  Another owner told us that the duration of exercise depends on how much time she has that day. It was clear how important tracking the exercise a dog is getting to inform the dog owners for them to make informed decisions on whether to exercise their dogs more.</p>
<h4 id="id-4-track-dog-s-body-shape">4.  Track dog’s body shape</h4>
<p>From our interview responses, we learned that some dog owners don’t have a scale at home to weigh their dog. Instead, they were taught by the veterinarians to feel for the ribs of their dogs. If the ribs can be felt distinctly, the dogs are not overweight. The reason this is taught is because dogs have a huge variance in what is considered a healthy weight. Things like size, age, sex, and breed are important factors when determining the correct weight range for a specific dog.  By reducing this complex formula to instead have an owner inspect a dog’s shape, it can provide a higher level of success. Therefore, tracking a dog’s body shape provides a more accurate judgment than the weight itself.</p>
<h4 id="id-5-track-which-dog-ate-from-the-food-bowl">5.  Track which dog ate from the food bowl</h4>
<p>Having multiple pets in one household can create an issue for owners as dogs’ don’t always feed themselves consistently. Some dogs prefer to graze throughout their day, while other dogs eat solely at their meal time. For owners with multiple dogs, this can cause an issue where an overweight dog could eat another dog’s food, making  their weight issue even worse. One of the interviewees has this situation. According to our interview findings, many owners can’t be home all day to monitor how many calories each dog consumes. Being able to automatically track when a dog’s eating, how much it eats, and from which food bowl, would help multiple-dog owners keep their pets healthy.</p>
<h4 id="id-6-track-a-dog-s-food-intake-from-various-sources">6.  Track a dog’s food intake from various sources</h4>
<p>Food intake is the primary factor affecting a dog’s weight. This can be a complex problem as there are so many varieties of dog food, each with their own calorie density. Also, based on our interviewees, many owners have trouble calculating exactly how many calories they are feeding their dogs based on the food labels. Meanwhile, dogs are often fed treats and scraps, and these calories are the most difficult to figure into their diet. Knowing the precise amount of calories a dog consumes would allow an owner to keep their dogs from becoming overweight.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches</h3>
<h4 id="design-1-food-intake-and-weight-monitoring-device-suite">Design 1: Food Intake and Weight Monitoring Device Suite</h4>
<p>This device suite is intended to use multiple tools together as a kit to help dogs stay within a healthy weight range (Figure 1). The first part is a smart food bowl with a sensor that detects and recognizes which dog reaches the bowl. It, then, provides that dog the amount of dog food set by the user in advance and notifies the user about it via a mobile application (Task 5 &amp; 6). The second part is a 3D model of a dog’s body shape built by the app with the pictures of the dog taken by the user. Then, it conducts an actual &amp; ideal body shape comparison analysis based on the 3D model and other data like dog breed and age in the application (Task 4). The last part is a smart scale that weighs a dog and sends weight-related data, such as weight and body fat, to the application (Task 1).</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Figure 1: Design 1 - Food Intake and Weight Monitoring Device Suite</p>
<h4 id="design-2-pure-manual-entry-application">Design 2: Pure Manual Entry Application</h4>
<p>Unlike the first design, this design focuses purely on the application and manual entry of data. Users need to manually input different kinds of data for collection and analysis. This allows pet owners to be more precise with their tracking. Based on the sketches below, the users will need to manually input data, such as the number of steps walked, the amount of calories eaten, to track and monitor their dogs’ food intake and exercise (Task 1, 3, 4). The user will also be able to manually locate a nearby pet clinic and seek professional help (Task 2).</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Figure 2: Design 2 - Pure Manual Entry Application</p>
<h4 id="design-3-dog-camera-wearable">Design 3: Dog Camera Wearable</h4>
<p>This design, unlike the second one, is all automatic. This is also different from the second design, which is an all-in-one design that only comes with a camera wearable and a mobile application. This is more convenient than the other two. The camera wearable works like a goPro and enables the user to check whether the dog’s eating when it’s not supposed to (Task 5 &amp; 6). In the application, the user can view the automatically collected exercise and food intake data (Task 3 &amp; 6). The data and clips of the dog can be sent to a vet for consultation (Task 2).</p>

<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboard">Selected Design and Storyboard:</h3>
<p>After considering the feedback we received for the design sketches and  re-evaluating our user needs, we decide to narrow the scope down and focus on a mobile application, a smart collar clip that includes a proximity sensor, GPS tracking, and a pedometer, and an optional tile sticker. Based on our interview responses, tracking food intake and exercise is crucial to help dogs maintain healthy weight. The smart clip is enough to accomplish these two main tasks. It tracks different exercise-related data. Meanwhile, it replaces the smart food bowl by tracking which dog is eating via the clip’s proximity sensor detecting the other sensor sticker on the food bowl. The collar clip doesn’t only simplify the process of collecting and analyzing data, but also reduces the cost for users.</p>
<h4 id="written-scenarios">Written Scenarios</h4>
<h4 id="track-which-dog-ate-from-the-food-bowl">Track which dog ate from the food bowl</h4>
<p>Tom recently graduated from the University of Washington and decided to start a professional career straight out of school. He has two dogs, Sled and Gabi. Sled was found as a stray and is a Husky crossbreed, and Gabi is a 2-year-old Australian Shepherd. They live in a one-story house with a fair amount of extended family. Tom regularly takes his dogs out for exercise and plays with them. He also brings them to the veterinarian for a check-up every three months. He feeds both dogs once a day. However, Gabi and Sled have different eating habits. Sled likes to eat everything at once and has his bowl put away, while Gabi likes to graze bit by bit and has her bowl left out throughout the day. Sled likes to steal food from Gabi’s bowl. He’s overweight because he eats way too much every day. Tom wants to know whether Sled has eaten Gabi’s food while he’s not home so he would not give him anymore treats when he gets home. Therefore, he purchased Feedo. Soon, he received the smart collar clip and the tile stickers and downloaded the app Feedo. Tom synced the collar to the application and put the tile stickers on the two food bowls. Now, when he’s not home, the application will receive a signal from the clip if Sled gets close to Gabi’s bowl and notify him about the situation. When Tom is notified, he would not give any more treats to Sled when he gets home. After using Feedo for a while, he found out that Sled likes to steal food most of the time, so he reduced the amount of food for Sled and added more food for Gabi. Now, both Gabi and Sled are eating the appropriate amount of food every day.</p>

<h4 id="track-and-monitor-a-dog-s-exercise">Track and monitor a dog’s exercise</h4>
<p>Drew is a first-year mid-career graduate student in the information management program at Cornell University. He is so busy going to school and work at the same time. He’s overwhelmed by the amount of work he needs to do every day. He lives in an apartment with his one-year-old Poodle, Joba. Taking Joba out for a walk is the only time he has for relaxation. During this time, he only wants to enjoy his leisure time and usually forgets to track the distance walked or the exact time spent, even if he is concerned about Jobabeing a little bit overweight. He would like to increase the intensity of exercise for Joba, but he doesn't know how much he should increase. One day, he was searching online for means to help dogs lose weight via exercise. He came across Feedo and purchased it right away. He received a smart collar clip and a proximity sensor the next day after his purchase. He downloaded the application as well. Now, when he takes Joba out for a walk, the smart clip’s GPS tracking and pedometer would detect it and sends a message through the application to confirm with Drew about whether he’s walking Joba. Once Drew confirms it, the clip will automatically record the distance walked, the time spent, the speed, and the approximate calories burnt. When they get home, the application will send a summary of the exercise for analysis. With the application’s pop-out confirmation, Drew never forgets to record the exercise-related data now. Also, by viewing the collected data, Drew now has a better idea of how much to increase the intensity of exercise for Joba.</p>

<ng-template #designresearch_fridgigotchi>
<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>In the United States, food waste is as prevalent as it is ecologically and economically damaging. The USDA estimates that between 30 and 40 percent of the food supply in America is wasted, equivalent to 133 billion pounds and $161 billion worth of food annually. That is 133 billion pounds of food that could have been used to feed the hungry and $161 billion in unnecessary spending for consumers. Additionally, methane released from wasted food represents 6.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and that isn’t even counting the emissions created from producing, transporting, and storing wasted food. Taken altogether, food waste is clearly a major issue in both the U.S. and internationally, and measures to reduce food waste would have benefits both ecologically and economically.</p>
<h3 id="our-solution">Our Solution</h3>
<p>To combat food waste we present Fridgigotchi, a refrigerator attachment that tracks food and helps people use their food before it spoils, all with a fun and cute Tamagotchi-like design. Fridgigotchi works by scanning either barcodes or receipts of recently purchased food and keeping track of estimated expiration dates. A screen would then display how close to spoiling each item is with “health bars” that lower as the food approaches spoilage. Fridgigotchi also recommends recipes based on the scanned food, aiming to get the food used well before it ends up in a landfill. As foods approach spoilage, Fridgigotchi starts to look sadder like an uncared for Tamagotchi, only looking happy again when the food has been used. We hope that this design inspires people to reduce food waste by gently encouraging them to use their perishables and warning them about spoilage well before it occurs.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-plans-and-goals">Design Research Plans and Goals</h3>
<p>Our focus with this project is to help people eat more sustainably, whatever form that might take. That could mean guiding people to more sustainably produced products in grocery stores, helping restaurant owners find ingredients from nearby farms or any other project that would help people help the planet with their food choices.To narrow down our project scope, we intend to interview an expert on sustainable eating to learn where we could have the most impact. Such an expert can likely be found within the UW sustainability network, and can be contacted through the department or their university email. We also want to see if we can assist restaurants in becoming more sustainable, so we plan to interview an owner of a restaurant that prides itself on sustainability to see how they what their approach is, and what improvements could be made. Broadfork, Cafe Flora, and Portage Bay are just a few of the local restaurants with good sustainability reputations that we could contact for interviews. Lastly, we suspect that the way to reach the most people would be through the grocery store, so we also intend to observe how a typical grocery store shopper decides what food to buy through contextual inquiry.
Through the Design Research, our goal is to explore potential problems in food waste, sustainable eating and understand how we could drive people toward sustainable eating in the participants’ perspective.  We try to understand the expert’s, restaurant owner’s and grocery shopper’s sustainable eating habits and experience.</p>
<h4 id="design-research-methods">Design Research Methods</h4>
<p>Since our goal focuses on eliciting information, exploring potential problems and narrowing down our scope, we choose interview as the primary method in our Design Research. In contrast, methods such as surveys would not be as helpful here as interview because they are more anonymous and restrict participants to a subset of predetermined answer options. Our method is primarily to conduct interviews with experts in sustainable eating, restaurant owners as well as grocery shoppers. We wrote a specific interview script with detailed questions we follow, conducted, recorded the interviews and took notes. In the interview script, we had two subsets of questions where one set of them is demographic about their background and another set is primary regarding our topic in sustainable eating. The first one with Amanda went very effectively and we learned a lot from the interview, so we decided to continue the interview approach with the rest of our participants. Each of them we had a different interview script and questions centering around the participants’ background and our goals for that participant.</p>
<h4 id="design-research-participants">Design Research Participants</h4>
<p>Based on the plan, we interviewed three participants including Amanda as the expert in the field, Beth as the sustainable restaurant owner and Betty as the grocery shopper.</p>
<h5 id="-amanda">“Amanda”</h5>
<p>Amanda is a student studying environmental science at UW that we interviewed in person on campus. She was definitely an expert in the field, an intern for 21 Acres (a center for sustainable agriculture in Washington), and involved in the sustainability community. We interviewed Amanda to get an expert opinion on the most important aspects of eating sustainably, as well as to get a sense of someone on a budget approaches sustainable buying and eating habits.</p>
<h5 id="-beth">“Beth”</h5>
<p>Beth is the head chef at Terra Plata, a Seattle restaurant with a significant focus on sustainability. We conducted an interview with her over the phone, with the goal of figuring out what an eco-minded restaurateur prioritizes when both buying produce and creating a menu.</p>
<h5 id="-betty">“Betty”</h5>
<p>Betty is a UW student living in Lander who does not normally consider sustainability when making decisions around food, but is interested to learn more about sustainable eating. We conducted an interview with her face-to-face, with a focus on finding out what kinds of sustainable eating habits that she felt were the most achievable.</p>
<h4 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research Results and Themes</h4>
<p>After conducting our interviews we were able to significantly narrow down our project scope.  The overall problem of sustainable eating was able to be broken down into four main pain points: consuming too much red meat, not buying food locally, not buying food in season, and wasting food.  Since our target audience is young people, we wanted to focus on problems that would have a low barrier of entry.  Buying food in season and reducing food waste were both problems that, when solved, would also benefit individuals making the behavior change (by costing them less money), so we decided to investigate those further.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing red meat consumption.</strong> One of the first things Amanda did to eat more sustainably was to cut red meat out of her diet. She told us that is by far the most consuming form of produce by far, and our own research has since borne that out. Red meat is responsible for 10 to 40 times as many greenhouse gasses as vegetarian produce, with cows in particular being responsible for up to 20% of all methane production. Unfortunately, we also found that getting people to reduce their red meat consumption to be largely infeasible. Beth, who puts a strong focus on sustainably sourcing her restaurant, still put burgers on her menu because she needed them to attract a wider base of eaters. Betty similarly said that going off of red meat would not be a lifestyle change she would be willing to make.</p>
<p><strong>Buying food locally and in season.</strong> One of the major things that we learned from participants is that buying food locally in season is one of the preferred and easier practices for them to be more sustainable. Because buying locally and eating in season does not significantly require much change in people’s eating habits. Moreover, we learned from Amanda that food transporting from other regions and countries, and food out of season(requires special temperature and light) contributes greatly to the carbon emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing food waste.</strong> Beth described reducing food waste as the primary way she tries to stay sustainable. She said that she tries to use every part of every ingredient she buys so that none of it goes to waste. She also keeps a close eye on the leftovers that come back to her kitchen, actively adjusting the portion sizes of her dishes to minimize how much her food gets thrown out. Wasted food is responsible for 6.7% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions2, so this is indeed an important way to improve our food sustainability. Betty also said that reducing food waste would be the lifestyle change she would be the most willing to make, which tells us that there is perhaps a better market for designs in this theme than the other two.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>Based on our design research, we decided on six tasks that we felt our design should strive to handle. The tasks themselves are bold.</p>
<p><strong>Figuring out what needs to be discarded.</strong> Based on the research, we learned that one problem with food waste is that expiry dates are often conservative. Many foods can still be consumed after their expiration date, but not everyone knows this, so they may end up throwing away perfectly good food.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing food with others.</strong> In the interviews, our expert and shopper both mentioned that they sometimes share food with their roommates before it goes bad, so we felt that making sharing food easier would be a good way to reduce food waste. Thus, because of its effectiveness and convenience for people to practice, we identify this task.</p>
<p><strong>Buying produce in season.</strong> The chef in particular said that she prioritized buying food produce that is in season above all else when deciding what ingredients to stock. This is both more sustainable as well as more cost effective. Moreover, we learned from Amanda that food out of season(requires special temperature and light) contributes greatly to the carbon emissions.
Because of how effective it is for promoting sustainability and the convenience for people to practice based on our research, we identify this task.</p>
<p><strong>Check and remember food expiration dates.</strong>  Based on our research, we learned a common trend that almost all participants often forget to check on their food, and food is often found spoiled too late. Thus, almost all participants want to solve this problem. Because of how common the problem is and the strong desire for people to change, we identify this task.</p>
<p><strong>Using food before it spoils.</strong> Betty mentioned that she sometimes forgets what she has in the fridge until it's too late, so actively encouraging people to use their food before it spoils seemed like a good way to prevent this. This also aligns with our goal of the “check and remember food expiration dates” task so we identify the task.</p>
<p><strong>Figuring out what to buy while at the grocery store and buying the right amount of food.</strong> Based on our research, we learned that one important way to reduce food waste is to not have too much food in the first place. This would likely mean getting people to be judicious when figuring out what and how much to get at the grocery store.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches</h3>
<h4 id="design-1-smartphone-app">Design 1: Smartphone App</h4>
<p>This design is an awesome app that helps reduce food waste, increases sustainability awareness and supports various functions. First, users could input their food data at home --- either by manually entering the product, scanning the barcode or by ML image recognition. After having all the available data and the exact expiration date, to prevent waste, the app reminds users (through notification)  when their food is about to expire (customizable). In addition to avoiding food waste, the app allows users to share any unused and extra food with others through social media. What’s more, the app gives users recommendations for similar in-season food when the food they are looking at buying is out-of-season.</p>

<h4 id="design-2-smart-fridge-with-fridgigotchi">Design 2: Smart Fridge with “Fridgigotchi”</h4>
<p>The idea behind the smart fridge is to keep track of what is currently in the refrigerator and use that to make suggestions for groceries or recipies. Sensors would track how full the fridge is (pressure sensors on each shelf) and what is going bad (gas sensors). The fridge would also be able to scan barcodes to more precisely know what it contains. The smart fridge would also have a large interactive screen display that can be used to get information about the food. A calendar to show estimated time to expiration, grocery suggestions based on what has been in the fridge in the past, and suggestions for recipes based on what is in the fridge now would all be display options. A fun, tamagotchi-like display (“Fridgigotchi”) would also be used to show what is going bad and should be eaten now.</p>

<h4 id="design-3-grocery-store-kiosk">Design 3: Grocery Store Kiosk</h4>
<p>This design is a smart grocery kiosk that promotes sustainability, minimizes food waste and provides customers with interesting information of relevant food data. The kiosk also contains the users’ previous purchase information and data. With this user data, the user can put their food in the kiosk to scan.  The kiosk will remind them if they just bought the same food a few days ago and give users a moment to reflect on if they actually need the food. In addition, by scanning the food, the kiosk provides information about this food such as what period of time in a year this kind of food is in season and how far it traveled to get to the store. What is more, with this rich user data, the kiosk can make suggestions based on the user’s purchasing habits.</p>

<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards</h3>
<h4 id="why-we-selected-this-design">Why We Selected this Design</h4>
<p>We decided to move forward with the Fridgigotchi design because we like the physical aspect of the smart fridge and the cute aspect of Fridgigotchi. We got feedback such as the fact that you cannot always see food spoiling, so it is good to have some sort of visual indicator.  Another comment was that portraying food like Tamagotchis is effective because the emotion related to seeing animate objects suffer will drive people to take action, rather than just seeing their food as inanimate objects.  We are interested in exploring the lifelike aspect of food since this is something that seems to be relatively unexplored, compared to smartphone apps on reducing food waste.  We think that creating a more emotional connection with the food will help motivate people to pay more attention to the food in their fridge.</p>
<h4 id="scenario-1">Scenario 1:</h4>
<p>John is living on his own for the first time and is learning how to manage the food in his fridge.  Since he often spontaneously goes out to eat, leftovers and groceries often sit in his fridge, rotting, without him noticing.  John realizes that he has been wasting a lot of food by letting it spoil, so he invests in a Fridgigotchi.  Since Fridgigotchi is displayed prominently on John’s fridge, he can “see” what is going on in his fridge simply by entering the kitchen.  John can see when Fridgigotchi is suffering.  Even when John does not know what is in his fridge, Fridgigotchi does, so it shows him what needs to be discarded, so John can safely discard the right foods.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/storyboard_1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="scenario-2">Scenario 2:</h4>
<p>John ends up throwing away a lot of food because his fridge is often a random assortment of ingredients he does not quite know what to do with.  These random foods often end up getting thrown out because John does not know how to combine them into anything useful.  John invests in a Fridgigotchi to help him.  Fridgigotchi tells John what foods are about to expire and suggests recipes for how to use different combinations of them.

<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview</h3>
<p>Our design uses concepts from <app-generated-link linkHREF="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025875">this paper</app-generated-link> as a model for the stages of getting out of an abusive relationship, namely the labeling of the <em>physical control</em>, <em>escape</em>, and <em>life apart</em> phases of such a relationship. The specific problem we are tackling is bridging the information gap between the abuser and the survivor. It is all too common for an abuser to cut their partner off from help and certain information sources and/or to have some sort of surveilance strategy in order to effectively exercise their control. We look to provide the survivor with some of the information they are lacking in order to help empower them to feel confident enough in their knowledge of the situation to begin to find ways out of it. Our specific focus is on network related information asymmetry, such as if an abuser is monitoring network activity as a tool in their control strategy.</p>
<p>The way we propose to do this is to have an internet connected HUB device that can be connected to a network that will monitor network activity <em>without contributing</em> to said network activity. The possibility of creating such a device that can monitor a network without speaking over it is the central assumption we have made in our design. The other assumption is that such a device could not be easily tampered with or reprogrammed, such as if an abuser managed to get their hands on it and tried to turn it into another tool they can use. The information collected by this device could be presented to the user via some client app or website to help inform decisions they make in their relationship, particularly as it pertains to how their network activity is being tracked.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants</h3>
<p>From the onset, we employed <em>value sensitive design</em> principles, with our primary focuses being <em>privacy</em> and <em>security</em>. The goal of our design research was to gain insight into what specific difficulties survivors face when trying to get out of an abusive relationship so we could narrow down on one big but specific problem we could design for.</p>
<p>Due to the sensitive nature of our problem space, we did not want to try to reach out to actual survivors of Intimate Partner Abuse (IPA) as we felt putting people in that situation wouldn't be fair to them. Initially, we read anonymous posts on online forums from survivors, which gave us some examples of the types of situations and ways in things could go wrong that we needed to consider in our design. We also read the aforementioned <app-generated-link linkHREF="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025875">paper</app-generated-link> as part of our design research. At this point we were also trying to make meetings with counselors on/near campus, hoping to interview them. We had no success in doing so. With the information we had at this point, we started making some designs.</p>
<p>We later had the opportunity to have a video call with one of the authors of the <app-generated-link linkHREF="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025875">paper</app-generated-link>. We went into the call with the mindset of it being a semi-structured interview. We already had some designs forming and some ideas for what we could do to help survivors of IPA, and we wanted to see which ideas made sense to someone who knew far more than us on the subject and which problems made no sense. The call ended up helping us to greatly narrow the scope of our design, which at the time was still far too broad and non-specific.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research Results and Themes</h3>
<p>The insights gained from each element of our design research helped to progressively narrow our scope down until we were down to a point that felt specific enough without being too small to produce a full design around.</p>
<p>The forum posts helped us cut out certain initial brainstorming ideas that made no sense or would be far too difficult to implement successfully.</p>
<p>The <app-generated-link linkHREF="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025875">paper</app-generated-link> provided our design some structure as we had a model with which to think of the process of getting out of an abusive relationship. It also provided more technology-specific insights into what design considerations made no real sense or, again, would be too difficult to implement correctly while accounting for all the nuance and individuality of each situation.</p>
<p>The video call with the author of the paper was pivotal in narrowing the scope of our design onto one specific problem that we could address fully. It was from this call that we narrowed down on designing for bridging the information gap between the abuser and the survivor. Previously we had been designing more for helping the survivor through the <em>escape</em> and <em>life apart</em> phases. Switching the focus to bridging the information gap also shifted which part of the process we were designing for. We are designing for transitioning from the <em>physical control</em> to <em>escape</em> phases.</p>
<p>One of the main takeaways of all our design research was that no one solution can solve every problem in our problem space. Our first designs had elements meant to assist with <em>escape</em> and <em>life apart</em>, while also tackling a task that had to do with transitioning from <em>physical control</em> to <em>escape</em>. We were trying to do too much and not devoting enough attention to any one of the problems we were considering. Once we narrowed our scope, we felt much happier with the direction the design was headed and much more confident in our ability to tackle the problem and produce a viable design solution. The more narrow scope also helped us understand what type of end-user we would be designing for, helping us also to apply some of the broader insights we gained from the earlier forum searches and from the <app-generated-link linkHREF="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025875">paper</app-generated-link> itself.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>Our initial 6 tasks for the 3 first design ideas we had were as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super Ultimate Secure Login</li>
<li>Total and Immediate Data Deletion</li>
<li>Remote Local Data Transfer from One Device To Another</li>
<li>Compile an Escape Plan</li>
<li>Obtain Relevant Information to Local Resources</li>
<li>Access Log of Login Attempts With Information About What Device has Attempted to Login</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea of our far-too-broad designs was to provide the user one secure, private, and centralized location in which to keep all their <em>escape</em> and <em>life apart</em> related plans. Privacy and security were central to many of the tasks we initially chose. We needed a very secure login process for this reason. We wanted data storage to be local so that it wouldn't exist anywhere except on the device it was being used. The data deletion and transfer were for emergency situations where the end user may not feel safe. The login attempt log was meant to inform potential data deletions if they user felt they were being tracked. We put a lot of thought into how to leave no trace of our solution's presence on the user's device in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>After we significantly narrowed our scope and modified our design, the two central tasks we designed for were as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the constant feed of network activity</li>
<li>Perform a cybersecurity analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>The network activity feed helps inform the user of how their network is being utilized, helping inform decisions on how and when to use the network the HUB device is connected to. Since we are assuming the device collects the information without being directly tracked by the network as it is doing is, this is a safe operation. The feed provides the user with information they would not otherwise have, and such information could assist them in forming a plan of how begin to wrangle free of the abuser's control.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity analysis gives advice where the network feed does not. It uses the data being collected by the HUB device to evaluate the safety of the network it is related to and make suggestions on how to improve cybersecurity. This could, for example, suggest that a user don't use their home network for anything related to getting out of their relationship and instead do such searching at a public place, like a library, where it cannot be tracked.</p>
<p>The internet could be a very valuable tool for survivors, but when they don't know how safe it is to use they can feel powerless to find a way out of an abusive relationship. These tasks help provide survivors with more information so they can know how to go about finding a way out of their situation.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches</h3>
<p>Our first three designs were created and sketched before the video call, so they are quite different from the design we ended up going with. Here's a very brief overview of each design and what considerations went into them.</p>
<h4 id="design-1">Design 1:</h4>
<p>The first design was focused on the <em>escape</em> phase and had the home screen as its central focus. The home screen linked directly to the tasks this design considered, making it quick and easy to access each of them after login. The primary focus of this design was the Escape Plan portion and the other tasks directly or indirectly contributed to the use of the Escape Plan. This design was meant to give the user one central place to store any <em>escape</em> and <em>life apart</em> planning related information.</p>

</div>
<h4 id="design-2">Design 2:</h4>
<p>The second design was centrally focused on being discrete and unassuming. It displayed a personalized interactive image, where certain gestures would perform the various tasks in this design, including the login process. Here we were exploring how to make it as difficult as possible for someone to even attempt to take control of the information in the app.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/design2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Design 2"></p>
<h4 id="design-3">Design 3:</h4>
<p>The third design shares the most similarities with our final design choice. This design was focused on device interaction logging and cybersecurity. The goal was to provide the user information about how their account was being accessed and make recommendation based off of this information.</p>
<p>Each of these three designs specifically addressed the login process, as safety and privacy are important values to consider for our design. We were always considering how to keep the artifact from getting into the wrong hands.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards</h3>
<p>After the video call and our decision to focus in on bridging the information gap between abuser and survivor, we knew we wanted to essentially take our &quot;interaction log&quot; task and blow that up into a full design of its own. In considering how to get more useful information than just login attempt information, we came up with the idea for the IoT HUB device that could be on a network. The device would collect network acticvity information for all devices on the network. We knew we had to make the aforementioned assumptions regarding its ability to collect information without contributing to network activity in relaying that information to the user for the design to work. With our assumptions made, we considered how to use the data the device would collect to present useful information to the user. From this, we came up with the two primary tasks of our design.</p>
<h4 id="checking-devices-interaction-log">Checking Devices Interaction Log</h4>
<p>Here, Joan uses the interaction log to understand the strange behavior in the IoT devices in her household. Joan could use the information to disable the devices' internet connectivity, or to replace the devices altogether to limit her abuser's opportunities to access any of Joan's network information. The information is presented to Joan in a way that is easy for her to understand so that she can make an informed decision in how to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>Since the data collected on the network is not limited to smart devices, the interaction log can also be used to understand some of the network behavior of more commonly used devices like desktops, laptops, and cell phones. This information can be used to make informed decisions on how to utilize the network that the HUB device is connected to.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/story1_1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Storyboard 1"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/story1_2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Storyboard 1"></p>
<h4 id="performing-cybersecurity-analysis">Performing Cybersecurity Analysis</h4>
<p>Here, the cybersecurity analysis is performed to find malicious activity on the network from the abuser's hacking attempts. The data from the HUB device is used to evaluate the security conditions of Joan's network, warning her of someone's attempts to hack in. Joan's response is to change her passwords, which can save her accounts being accessed by her abuser as he tries to regain control of Joan.</p>
<p>In an alternative example, one could use the cybersecurity analysis to receive recommendations on whether or not the HUB's network is safe to use freely or if there is another device on the network tracking activity. This type of information can be empowering for a survivor to take a step in the direction of getting out of their situation if they can be made aware of where they're free to use the internet without fear of being tracked or surveilled by their abuser.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/story2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Storyboard 2"></p>
<p>Overall, our design looks to provide the end user with information about their network and cybersecurity that it may otherwise be difficult to obtain. Through this infomration, one may feel empowered in their understanding of their situation, leading them begin to find a way out of it.</p>

TODO: It would be nice to have a place to put their tagline
productivity with intention
--> 
<p>Today, people seem to be more attached to their smartphone than ever before. Their work life, social life, and down time appear to all revolve around one device which has instant access to all of the world’s collective information. However, instead of using their phone as a productive tool, many people seem to have an unhealthy relationship with their device. We wanted to get to the root of this relationship and understand why phones aren’t being used to maximize different areas of people’s lives to their fullest potential.</p>
<p>Through our research, we found that students and working professionals often found themselves unaware of the time that they spent on their phone and that they weren’t consciously choosing what they wanted to do on their phones. That’s why we created mode: a productivity app that helps you both actively and passively manage your screen-time in a way that works for you. Mode helps to keep you aware of the time you’re spending on your device through a plant on the home screen that grows as you continue to use your phone in a healthy way. Mode also lets you switch between work and play functionality, which restricts which apps you can access at any given time, allowing you to be fully intentional with the way you use your phone.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants</h3>
<p>We decided to format our design research as a combination of interviews and informal diary study. The interview was structured to have three different stages: perception, revelation, and reflection. For the first stage of the interview, we asked participants questions about their current phone usage. In the next stage we had our participants take out theirs phones and navigate to their personal Screen Time data, which was then followed by the final stage, which was about absorbing and reflecting upon that data. We asked participants to gauge the differences between their perceived phone usage and their raw data and reflect upon that difference.</p>
<p>This interview structure was important in that it allowed us to better understand the possible problems that arise when people are confronted with the data that either supports or rejects their perception of reality in regard to phone usage.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/participants.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>We contacted a college student, a graduate student, and a young working professional to conduct our research. Phone usage isn't a problem restricted to one age group and we wanted to explore multiple occupations to see different problems.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research Results and Themes</h3>
<p>After we conducted the research, we compared our participants' perceived phone usage and their actual usage. Also, we documented their reflection on the difference between perceived and actual usage. Our participants also mentioned their concern about their current behavior and what they are looking forward to as a potential solution to help them. The followings are the key findings we have:</p>
<p><strong>Balance Between Work and Leisure Activities</strong></p>
<p>Our first participant, the college student, sought the balance between work and leisure activities, Aa there is no clear boundary between class/work and personal life for her. However, the graduate student and the working professional actively exercised this balance.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Awareness Regarding Phone Screen Time</strong></p>
<p>In the majority of our users, we found a disconnect between their perceived and actual usage of their phone. For the most part, users underestimated their usage and we’re surprised to see the amount of time they spent on their phone.
Partial versus complete restriction of phone
Our users also mentioned that when they sought to restrict their usage, they didn’t want to lock their whole phone down. Rather, they needed to restrict access to certain apps that they found distracting, while leaving others available.</p>
<p><strong>Subconscious Scrolling on Social Media</strong></p>
<p>Finally, our users found themselves constantly scrolling through different feeds on their phone. In particular, our college student was shocked by the amount of time she spent on a single social media app throughout the week.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>Throughout our design research, we observed what our participants did to enhance their productivity with their phone. Moreover, we discovered concern regarding their phone usage. We came up with six tasks that our participants perform that reflect our findings:</p>
<p><strong>1. Being Present in the Moment When With Family and Friends</strong></p>
<p>Our participants turned off their phone and notification, so they can enjoy the moment with their family.</p>
<p><strong>2. Blocking Notifications After Work and Before Bedtime</strong></p>
<p>With an increasing ability to communicate with their friend, our participants felt anxious about the bombarding messages throughout the day and decided to turn off the notification.</p>
<p><strong>3. Using Phone for Work Productivity</strong></p>
<p>Our participants use Slack, Messenger, Canvas, and email to communicate with their co-workers.</p>
<p><strong>4. Browsing Phone for Extended Periods of Time</strong></p>
<p>Some of our participants are not aware of their actual usage of their phone, and they are surprised by how much more usage they spent a day than they estimated.</p>
<p><strong>5. Limiting Time on Certain Social Media Apps</strong></p>
<p>Realizing that they spent too much time of the social media apps, our participants decided to completely disable their apps during work hours.</p>
<p><strong>6. Using a Smartphone in Place of Computer</strong></p>
<p>As a product manager, one of our participants used her phone as the primary tool to communicate with her team when she is commuting.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches</h3>
<p><strong>Design 1: Modes</strong></p>
<p>This design focuses on partitioning your phone into two different modes: social and work. These modes are activated by a notification that appears only on the lock screen, forcing the user to commit to the activity that they want to use the phone for. After unlocking the phone, depending on the mode chosen, different apps will show up on your home screen. In work mode, only apps related to things such as email, business messaging, and schoolwork will show up on the home screen. In social mode, only apps related to social media, gaming, and entertainment will show up on the home screen. There will be presets for which mode each app fits in, but ultimately, the user can decide which app they want in each mode.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/design1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><strong>Design 2: Social</strong></p>
<p>This design is implemented as an application that limits functionality of users' phones to let them be present in the moment while tracking the overall phone usage of everyone. In this application, the home screen shows different groups that the user is in. Before a specific group decides to hang out in person, the group members can send a &quot;Request Lockout&quot;. If everyone agrees with the lockout, their phone functionality will be limited according to their set goals during a specific period of time. For example, if the users plan to decrease usage on Instagram, Facebook, and games to encourage in-person communication, the lockout will block those apps for two hours when they are hanging out. Clicking a group, the user can see the group members' overall usage of different categories of apps throughout the week. When the user clicks on a category of app in the pie chart, it will show individual usage of different members.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/design2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><strong>Design 3: Plant Visual</strong></p>
<p>This design will act as a passive way of notifying the user about their phone usage by displaying a plant in the user’s home screen. When the user is spending too much time on their phone, the plant wilts. Conversely, when the user spends less time on their phone, the plant will grow. If the user spends too many days beyond their limit, the plant will die. Some statistics will be shown along with the plant like how long the current plant has been kept alive, the total number of plants killed and the longest time a single plant is kept alive. Users can also set which apps support or diminish plant health in their settings, tailoring limits to their particular usage.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/design3.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards</h3>
<p>We ultimately decided to move forward with a combination of two of our designs:</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/venn.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>For the work and play modes we want an active way for users to intentionally switch between modes when they want to take a break and relax or sit down to focus on their work. With the plant, we have a passive way to visually indicate time usage. Despite most phones having graphs and charts of time usage, we found that our participants did not look at their data despite knowing about the functionality. The plant growth will be mapped to goals that a user sets for themselves. If they wish to spend less time on an app, the plant will decay faster when using that app and if they wish to spend more time on an app, the plant will grow accordingly. We find it very important that the user has the ability to set their own limits and apps to their personal needs.</p>
<p><strong>Storyboard 1:</strong></p>
<p>Mark is about to head into work, but sees that he’s been using his phone all morning and his plant is dying. To prevent distraction, he puts his phone into work mode and gets to work. During his lunch break, he switches his phone back to normal and sees that his plant has grown while he’s been productive.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/storyboard1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><strong>Storyboard 2:</strong></p>
<p>Our second storyboard focuses on how people can limit time on certain social media apps. During bedtime, Sarah is scrolling through Instagram and unknowingly spends more than two hours on her phone. Moving to her home screen, she notices that her plant is beginning to wilt so she consciously puts down her phone and opens up a book instead.</p>

Capture life as it happens
--> 
<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview:</h3>
<p>Taking photos is a convenient and effective way of keeping a record of the past scenes in our lives.  However, sometimes being in a rush on either a road or business trip, it is hard to find time to take a picture of every moment one might want to capture. And it is even harder to keep in mind every detail one might want to remember. But if we cannot recall the stories behind the pictures afterwards, those photos may have already lost much of its meaning.
Our solution is a wearable camera that can be attached to any clothes or hat. Pictures can be taken by a voice command or click of a button. For users who want to capture every moment without their intervention, auto capture is an option. The audio record feature helps to save all the details behind the lens of a camera. Pictures are shared with a phone, where they are organized into trips or searched by a keyword.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants:</h3>
<p>Our design research initially focused on gathering data about the process of taking notes for photos. We used semi-structured interviews and tried to interview a variety of demographics. After interviewing our first candidate, we reflected on the primary use case for our app and decided that travel might be a slightly more focused design space to explore. This decision was driven in large part due to the current apps and processes that are already entrenched in many people’s photo arsenals. Our first interviewee had a very specific workflow using Instagram and Snapchat, and we felt that it would be exceedingly difficult to create a product that could be inserted into daily usage alongside these popular apps. With a specific area to focus on, we constructed questions to digest how photos play into how people currently travel. Since the major focus for our project was about helping to capture memories, a big portion of our interview was very functional in exploring the storytelling and reflecting process. The rest of our interview questions focused on pinpointing the pain points that currently exist when taking lots of photos in a short time period, as happens while travelling.</p>
<p>We targeted both men and women to interview. Our age range was mostly targeted at the young adults. Although our product is focused on aiding memory, we decided against creating something specifically for the elderly as we felt many older people don’t take many photos compared to the younger generation. We specifically looked to interview people that had gone on a trip in the distant past (over two years prior) to see how well they could recall the trip through looking at their photos.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research Results and Themes:</h3>
<p>We had several ideas about potential directions heading into our interviews. Many of our initial ideas were somewhat polarizing. Since photos are such an intimate form of communication, our interviewees had varying levels of comfort regarding privacy. There were, however, several key themes that held true through all of our interviewees.</p>
<p>When asked about journaling or taking notes to assist in memory, many of our interviewees expressed that taking notes for photos requires too much effort. Most expressed that they had the desire to record more than just what they had photos of. Despite this, none of the candidates even considered journaling as a viable option due to the effort and level of commitment required. When prompted, several interviewees indicated that they would prefer to take notes on the spot, and would likely support a voice memo concept that enables lightweight and instant note-taking.</p>
<p>When asked why they took photos, interviewees brought up that photos are often used to convey a story. Although some photos were shared on social media, the majority of photos were often taken to piece together a narrative of the whole trip to share with friends and family. Many photos were taken to help illustrate interesting or funny stories encountered along the trip, an example being a grocery store selling a whole chicken in a box in Malaysia. The same interviewee also seemed to recall certain information only after reflecting on his photos. He had to be prompted about the sequence of the photos to remember additional details about the trip such as the timing of certain events and small interactions that weren’t photo-worthy. We decided that the usage of photos in conveying a story should be a core focus since most current photo taking apps largely emphasize the photos rather than the circumstances around the photos.</p>
<p>Almost all interviewees had some group photos/photos taken with others. Our interviewees indicated that group photos are always shared with members of the photo. They indicated that group photos are a great way to remember a shared experience, and that the photo is as much for everyone else included in the picture as it is for themselves. Sharing photos can oftentimes be somewhat of a hassle purely due to the extra steps it takes after taking photos, but our interviewees still found it important enough to put in the extra effort. Thus, we viewed the sharing of photos as an essential process that provided an opportunity for streamlining.</p>
<p>Among nearly all interviewees, one major pain point in dealing with photos is that searching for specific photos can be time consuming. One interviewee tried searching for photos from their Cambodia trip, but could not find them readily because the photos were grouped by city instead of by country. There were also times when an interviewee would tell a story and try to find the corresponding photo. We took this as a sign that we could implement a better way to search, potentially including the personal context of a photo as a searchable field.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Taking photos.</p>
<p>Pictures can be taken with just a simple voice command or a click of a button. Settings will also allow users to choose how often pictures to be taken and what kind of signal to be used (if any).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding descriptions to photos.</p>
<p>Users add voice memos right at the moment when a photo is taken. Then, the application will have an option to play the recording, or automatically transcribe it and add as text notes and keywords to the photo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Searching for specific photos.</p>
<p>Custom keywords and tags are added to each photo. The application will allow users to do a  search for a photo not only by location or date, but also via advanced and personalized keywords.</p>

<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches:</h3>
<p>We came up with three different designs to address the problems we have learnt from the users. Each design focuses on a different use case and a set of tasks that the user can perform. Our first design is a travel photo management app that mainly addresses the pain points of existing camera and album apps, to make it more convenient and efficient for users to manage their travel photos. However, since we realized that there are also some inconveniences for people to even take photos when traveling, we came up with our second design - a wearable mini camera, to enable people to capture their travel moments more easily. Moreover, when analyzing our user research results, we found out that some user problems are specific to group travel scenarios. Therefore, we also designed an app to specifically enhance the group travel experience.</p>
<h4 id="design-1-travel-photo-management-app">Design 1 - Travel Photo Management App</h4>
<p>The first design is a mobile app focused on the improvement of existing mobile camera and album applications. It enables a few tasks that the users wish they could perform, including capturing stories, organizing, sharing and searching for photos. Users can record a voice memo when taking photos and the app will automatically transcribe it to a textual description of the photo. Users can then share the photos and the descriptions to others in a story format. Having the descriptions, the app allows more specific search function based on the keywords in photo descriptions. Moreover, the app can suggest blurred and duplicate photos to users for deletion.</p>

<h4 id="design-2-wearable-mini-camera">Design 2 - Wearable Mini Camera</h4>
<p>The wearable mini camera is a portable camera that can be attached to any model of glasses or pinned to the clothes. It is as lightweight and un-intrusive as possible to attach to any item of clothing, targeted for any user who wants to capture a photo without breaking a moment. Users can interact with the camera through buttons on the camera or voice command in order to take photos or record voice descriptions of the photo. The photos and voice memos are automatically transmitted to a mobile app, which allows users to manage or share the photos.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/design2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="design-3-group-travel-enhancement-app">Design 3 - Group Travel Enhancement App</h4>
<p>This travel enhancement app is targeted at groups travelling together, with the primary goal of making group travel as painless as possible. In this app, multiple users can specify that they will travel together, forming a travel group. Within this travel group, photos will be automatically shared among members, and suggestions for future itinerary will be offered to each user based on past travel history.</p>

<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards:</h3>
<p>We have chosen to further develop our Wearable Mini Camera design. Based on our user research, we found out that people have various needs and pain points in different stages of the photo taking and management process. Reflecting on our initial goal of helping people remember more precious moments, we decided to focus on the “upstream” problem first, which is to enable people to capture more photos and stories easily when traveling. Together with the camera, we also want to design a mobile app, which stores all the good photos taken by the camera, and provides some essential functions in our first design for people to easily manage their photos.</p>

<h3 id="problem-solution">Problem &amp; Solution</h3>
<p>In the United States, up to 40% - or around 70 million tons - of food produced is wasted, costing around $220 billion a year. For the average 4-person family, this costs them around $1500 per year. Globally, food waste is around 33%, with more developed countries having higher percentages of food wasted.</p>
<p>Food waste in the U.S. is an important issue because of its impact on our economy and the environment. Besides being expensive in terms of opportunity cost, there are further environmental impacts due to depletion of land agriculture, natural resources, and freshwater supplies. In addition, rotting food in landfills is a major source of methane emissions, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change at about 30 times the potency as carbon dioxide. Lastly, wasted food results in a smaller food supply, raising costs for consumers. Because food is necessary for survival and generally regarded as a human right, excessive food waste can contribute to the poor and disadvantaged being denied the right to feed themselves.</p>
<p>Current solutions exist to reduce or prevent food waste, but they address different stages of the farm-to-table process. Companies like Misfits Market, Imperfect Produce, and Hungry Harvest ship “ugly produce&quot; that are rejected from supermarkets directly to consumers to minimize wasted produce. Smart fridges are also used to automatically track personal inventory, but these are often impractical and expensive, costing over $2000 for a new appliance that is usually already present in most people’s homes.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/smartfridge.jpeg" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-participants">Design Research: Goals, Methods, Participants</h3>
<p>We conducted our design research with the goal of understanding specific grocery shopping habits of our various participants, focusing in particular on discovering which habits led to wasted food for each individual. Because our problem spanned a range of populations -- essentially any household that utilizes a fridge -- our research focused on how individual habits uniquely contributed to each individual’s food waste.</p>
<p>To encapsulate the largest span of this diverse population, our participants included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jim (pseudonym):</strong> A college student living in a small shared household, shares a fridge and mostly shops for individual groceries</li>
<li><strong>Sam (pseudonym):</strong> A college student living in a large shared household, shares a fridge and mostly shops for individual groceries</li>
<li><strong>Jody (pseudonym):</strong> A mom of a family of five, shopping and cooking for the whole family</li>
<li><strong>Lily (pseudonym):</strong> A college student living in a single studio apartment, shopping and cooking for themselves without sharing any groceries</li>
</ul>
<p>By capturing a diversity of household sizes and who the participants are shopping for, we hoped to maximize the variation in responses and discover a greater range of grocery habits.</p>
<p>We initially started with contextual inquiries to understand each participant’s spending habits, in particular seeking out what tradeoffs participants made when deciding which groceries to purchase. After observing participants one and two while grocery shopping, though, we learned that the physical grocery store environment had little impact on their eventual shopping habits, and so we instead turned to interviews for participants three and four.</p>
<p>Lastly, in addition to these interviews and observations, we asked participants to log diary entries of their food waste over a period of about five days; the goal of these logs were to identify how a specific shopping habit might lead to a certain amount or type of food wasted. In the end, these diary logs did not provide much insight into patterns of food waste in large part due to the short period of time, but also because many individuals were already fairly aware and conscious of wasting food.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research: Results and Themes</h3>
<p>Following our design research, we realized that despite the variety of participants involved in our research, they each identified the same main challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Difficulty keeping track food items:</strong> All of our participants mentioned difficulties in tracking what food items they currently had at home. Jody would frequently call her kids to ask what was in the fridge, and Jim would stop in the middle of the grocery store to think back to what he could remember seeing in his fridge. This meant that participants would end up forgetting to repurchase items that they ran out of, or end up with too many items that they rarely used: Jody specifically mentioned that they had three bags of brown sugar because since she rarely used it, she would forget that they already had enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knowing how to use up food:</strong> As a follow-up to the difficulties in tracking their current foods, participants also discussed how they would struggle to think of ways to use up the foods they had. Much of their new grocery purchases would be dependent on how to create new meals that would use up their leftover food items, and so the challenge of using up foods involves both meal ideation, as well as tracking how much of what food item they still had for these new meals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of planning before grocery shopping:</strong> As both students and working adults, all the participants rarely planned their grocery shopping ahead of time: they would fit in a stop at the store whenever and wherever they could. This lack of planning contributed to their difficulty in keeping track of their groceries, and so we knew our design would need to be efficient and convenient to integrate into their existing lifestyle and grocery shopping practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Awareness of their food waste:</strong> Lastly, each participant was already aware of their food waste, and wanted to avoid unnecessarily throwing away food items. Jim explicitly cited that Trader Joe’s excessive plastic packaging bothered him, and Sam mentioned her own preference towards environmentally-friendly produce (e.g. locally-sourced and organic). This meant that our problem and proposed solution to minimize food waste was desired by our population, and that individuals would be interested in more effective ways to practice better habits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These insights were realized mostly from the interviews and contextual inquiry, as we asked specifically about what their goals were while grocery shopping and how they managed their food items. Although the diary logs were interesting to understand how much food was wasted for each participant, it did not help us to identify specific patterns or trends that led to wasted food.</p>
<h3 id="tasks">Tasks</h3>
<p>Although each participant went about their grocery shopping differently than the others, they all shared tasks that were common practice regardless of where they shopped, or what their goals were while grocery shopping.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Task 1: Keeping track of current groceries at home</strong></p>
<p>Having an inventory of groceries at home is important so that users do not buy excess amounts of a food item. Our participants usually called a friend or family member at home to coordinate their shopping trips.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task 2: Choosing new groceries to incorporate with current groceries</strong></p>
<p>Part of the difficulty of using up extra food is finding ways to prepare it in different ways. During shopping trips, participants reported trying to find new ingredients that could be prepared with old ingredients in order to use up existing inventory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task 3: Measuring shelf life of foods and how long it will take to consume items</strong></p>
<p>Shelf lives vary based on food, and it is difficult to tell if a food item is close to going bad besides using smell/appearance, which is impractical for large inventories. Our participants stated that they forgot about what was expiring sometimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task 4: Clearing out foods that have gone bad</strong></p>
<p>Clearing foods that have gone bad requires being able to track which foods have gone bad. Being able to measure shelf life of foods would also help track which foods have gone bad and thus allow participants to clear these food items out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task 5: Sharing excess food to prevent wasting food and money</strong></p>
<p>Sharing food that is about to go bad allows less food to be wasted. Participants in non-family shared households wanted to borrow their roommates’ food at times and were willing to share their own excess food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task 6: Prioritizing fresh produce that participants want</strong></p>
<p>Individuals want to be able to find the products they eat all the time, but there is never a reliable way to know what stores will have what they want. Often-times, they never go home with the groceries they intend to purchase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design-sketches">Design Sketches</h3>
<h4 id="design-1-organization-and-food-storage">Design 1: Organization and Food Storage</h4>
<p>This first design utilizes a basket or placemat design that users could place into their fridge to organize their food items by category. These baskets and placemats would track the item’s mass over time, and allow users to check in real-time exactly what food item they had at that exact moment, and also display their food waste trends, utilizing a mobile app to display this information. Additionally, it could provide possible recipes based on the exact food and amount they had available to them in their fridge.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/sketch1a.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 450px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/sketch1b.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 450px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>

<h4 id="design-2-digital-grocery-list">Design 2: Digital Grocery List</h4>
<p>This design utilizes a mobile app that would allow users to track their groceries and know exactly when each item was purchased. Users could take a picture of their receipt after grocery shopping, and the app would digitize their receipt, knowing exactly what was purchased and on what day. It would also have a “food friend&quot; feature where you could add friends that also used the app, and indicate which of your foods are shared and see which of their foods are shared. This compiles a holistic grocery inventory based on your purchases, as well as what other items are shared for you to use. Thus, users could know exactly what was available to them and when they were purchased.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/sketch2.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 450px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="design-3-food-waste-tracker">Design 3: Food Waste Tracker</h4>
<p>This mobile app addresses the tail end of groceries by tracking how old foods are, and highlighting which items are expiring soon. It would prompt you whenever foods are expiring soon or have already gone bad, as determined by the expected expiration date, sending a notification to prompt you to clean out your food. It would also provide visualizations for users to see their exact food waste trends by week or month, as well as a “month in review&quot; to see how much of what was wasted.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/sketch3a.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 450px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/sketch3b.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 450px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/sketch3c.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 450px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="selected-design-storyboards">Selected Design &amp; Storyboards</h3>
<p>Overall, the most practical design we chose that could accommodate the tasks we listed was a mobile app (combining both grocery recording and expiry date tracking features from designs 1 and 3). An app provided more flexibility in recording and analyzing data than an individual device like the placemats in design 2. Additionally, users would be able to coordinate grocery shopping trips with their inventory at home just by using their phone, which many participants already use to either record their grocery list or call home to double check items. Thus, a mobile app was the most easy to integrate into the participants’ everyday lifestyle.</p>
<h4 id="storyboard-1">Storyboard 1</h4>
<p>A shopper goes about their usual grocery routine, purchasing items they would usually buy during each trip. Instead of trying to recall what they still have at home or calling someone to check their fridge and pantry, the shopper can refer to their phone as they walk through the store themselves. They can check for when the last time they purchased a certain grocery item, and use this to decide what items they will need to repurchase or what else they can buy to supplement their current items. After checking out, they can take a photo of their receipt and the app will record all the new items purchased on that trip, updating the purchase date and predicted expiration dates.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/storyboard1.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="storyboard-2">Storyboard 2</h4>
<p>As foods get old and their expiration date approaches, the mobile app will send a notification to remind individuals about these items. It can then offer ways of disposing the food as well as the food’s packaging, and they can see how much of food they have thrown away over time. As the app is used more and more, it can suggest more optimal purchase amounts for each food item that is thrown away.</p>

<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview</h3>
<p>In today’s society, many quantify personal success with awards and achievements instead of happiness and health. Such a mindset causes people to prioritize their work over all else, and many people neglect both their physical and mental health - according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, “1 in 5 U.S. adults experience mental illness each year” [1]. Bullet journaling is an existing method for people to manage their schedules or thoughts, and focuses on improving efficiency and mindfulness. However, it is inconvenient, time-consuming, and intimidating. It currently exists as a physical form where people can spend hours designing their journal spreads, only to abandon them after infrequent use. The online journaling community can also be intimidating for those with limited art experience, as many journalists use social media to share their extravagant spreads.</p>
<p>Our proposed solution, Pocket Planner, transforms bullet journaling into a hybrid digital and physical experience with a smart journal and an app. This maintains the same efficiency as bullet journaling but removes the restriction of a paper journal, making it portable and convenient. By providing people with semi-automated tracking, clear data visualization, and different methods to record their emotions, Pocket Planner can personalize bullet journaling to make it more efficient, empowering, and accessible to all.</p>
<p>[1] <em>National Alliance on Mental Illness, “Mental Health By The Numbers”, 2019. <span style="white-space: nowrap;">https://www.nami.org/learn-more/mental-health-by-the-numbers.</span> Accessed: 14-Feb-2020</em></p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants</h3>
<p>We conducted our design research through semi-structured interviews with people who currently journal or used to journal but quit, diary studies with people who do not journal at all, and contextual inquiries with people who used to journal but have adapted their methods. Our goal was to understand how people viewed bullet journaling and how they practiced self-reflection and daily planning.</p>
<p>Each research method helped us narrow down our tasks and exposed both important and inconvenient aspects of bullet journaling. Our contextual inquiry showed that a paper journal forces people to flip back and forth while transferring information between pages. The diary studies indicated how people with limited experience with tracking and journaling approached the idea of bullet journaling. Our interview participants also modified their journaling methods over the years to suit their own schedules and comfort levels. Understanding participant perspectives regarding the hardships of a physical journal while still acknowledging the importance of a tactile experience helped us refine our thinking and approach.</p>
<h3 id="stakeholders-and-participants">Stakeholders and Participants</h3>
<h4 id="semi-structured-interviews-and-contextual-inquiries">Semi-Structured Interviews and Contextual Inquiries</h4>
<p><strong>Participant 1:</strong> We conducted a semi-structured interview with Cathy, a 27-year-old woman who retired 2 years ago and is now a stay-at-home mother. She used to journal but it was too time-consuming, so she switched to using a pre-printed planner. Writing things down helps her stay organized, but paper planners are not portable. Cathy believes bullet journaling with others can help her stay accountable and motivated.</p>
<p><strong>Participant 2:</strong> We conducted a semi-structured interview with Betty, a 22-year-old masters student at UW who uses Google Sheets to manage her tasks. She likes the customization and synchronization of an electronic form, since she can access her journal across different platforms. Betty would like a journal that displays statistical data, such as how many steps she takes or how many books she has read.</p>
<p><strong>Participant 3:</strong> We conducted a semi-structured interview and contextual inquiry with Jane, a 24-year-old tax accountant intern and graduate student at SU. She used to design her own journal templates, but now uses a pre-printed planner to save time. Writing notes on paper helps her actively register information. Jane tracks her weekly schedule to prevent herself from getting overwhelmed. During the contextual inquiry, she frequently flipped back and forth while transferring events between spreads.</p>
<p><strong>Participant 4:</strong> We conducted a semi-structured interview with Abby, a 19-year-old undergraduate at UW studying architectural design. She has bullet journaled for over 5 years to track her tasks, mood, and activities. Her bullet journaling has evolved from intricate monthly spreads to practical daily entries, which has helped relieve her anxiety. She enjoys writing or doodling with pens and paper, but thinks that digital journals are more convenient.</p>
<h4 id="diary-studies">Diary Studies</h4>
<p>We designed a bullet journal template to conduct diary studies with five people who did not bullet journal before. Most of them already had their own methods for planning, such as Google Calendar or paper planners. During the diary studies, our participants barely filled out the trackers because they forgot to use their journals, left them at home, or did not find any reason to write anything down.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research Results and Themes</h3>
<h4 id="summary-of-key-findings">Summary of Key Findings</h4>
<p>While we initially considered converting the entire experience of bullet journaling to a digital form for greater accessibility and efficiency, we decided to maintain a physical aspect in our design based on our research findings. We found that the inconvenience of daily tracking was a major reason why people quit journaling, which encouraged us to consider alternate methods of interacting with the journal.</p>
<h4 id="common-themes">Common Themes</h4>
<p><strong>People rarely have the motivation to self-track.</strong>
According to our design research, most participants forget to mark their trackers and end up abandoning them. It is difficult for participants to reflect when trackers are separate from the rest of their spreads, and must be manually updated on a daily basis. Jane (Participant 3) incorporated mindfulness into her scheduling by dividing her workload across multiple days. This theme shows us that we should focus on adapting bullet journals and methods of interacting with them to encourage mindfulness on a daily basis, and incorporate an automated system to collect tracking data to inform people about their progress towards habits and goals.</p>
<p><strong>People lack convenient access to their notes.</strong>
One of the core ideas of bullet journaling is that it serves as a centralized organization tool. This has proven to be effective for practicing mindfulness for both Cathy (Participant 1) and Jane (Participant 3), as they can see all of their plans in one place. However, Cathy, Betty (Participant 2), and Abby (Participant 4) also hoped to have more convenient access to their journals, envisioning a digital version of their journals for on-the-go scenarios which can be accessed without a physical planner. We also realized that having a digital form can prevent flipping back and forth between pages. This theme shows us that our design should provide a digital version for convenient access when physical planners are not with users or are impractical to use.</p>
<p><strong>People find the action of physically writing to be helpful.</strong>
Three participants stated that writing down their to-do lists and schedules on paper is helpful. Cathy (Participant 1) noted that writing notes helped her stay organized and be realistic while assigning tasks for herself, while Jane (Participant 3) mentioned how writing helps her register information in her brain and retain more about her schedule. Abby (Participant 4) explained how the act of writing helps relieve her stress and anxiety. This theme shows us that having a tactile experience can give people a designated space to be more intentional with their thoughts and tasks, helping them slow down and reflect upon their day.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>From our research, we were able to identify six primary tasks. Bullet journaling already incorporates the idea of tracking habits, writing tasks or thoughts, and accessing all items in one place, and we decided to explore making these tasks digitized. In addition, our participants indicated that joining a supportive community, having visualization and graphs for their trackers, and developing more ways to journal would all keep them more accountable to journaling on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Track daily activities, goals, and habits to monitor or develop.</strong>
Tracking helps people maintain healthy habits and activities, and it can even motivate them to develop a new one. Manual tracking is difficult to stick with and discourages those who do not have experience, as noted by Cathy (Participant 1). To make habit tracking less of a chore, we are adapting our journal design to incorporate an semi-automated tracking system. This data, collected and reported for a variety of user-entered goals, can inform participants about their progress towards their habits.</p>
<p><strong>Visit a platform to gain inspiration from other journalists.</strong>
With the rise of social media, people can usually find a community to encourage and motivate them to pursue an activity. Cathy (Participant 1) mentioned that journaling with others might encourage her to restart and stay accountable. We are focusing on having a platform where participants can encourage and support each other, as well as gain inspiration by learning from other journalists’ experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Be intentional with your tasks by writing them down.</strong>
Three of our interview participants stated that writing down their to-do lists and schedules on paper was helpful; they found the act of writing to be therapeutic. Writing and visualizing schedules also helps people retain more information and be realistic with the tasks they have, so they can avoid overbooking themselves. Therefore, we are keeping the idea of a physical journal, as the act of writing can encourage mindfulness and relieve stress.</p>
<p><strong>Record and transcribe verbal reflections or conversations for quicker journaling.</strong>
While writing down tasks and goals promote mindfulness when developing schedules, writing diary entries can be difficult. People often spend time talking about their days with friends, but there is no way to capture those memories with a bullet journal. To reduce the overhead for reflecting upon one’s mood, we are adding the ability to record and transcribe verbal reflections. This empowers participants to communicate their emotions to others and makes bullet journaling more accessible to participants in the blind or visually impaired community.</p>
<p><strong>Visualize statistical data of plans, habits, or goals.</strong>
Two of our diary study participants did not see the virtue of tracking their goals or habits and they lacked the motivation to track and practice self-reflection in their lives. We hope to encourage tracking and reflection on a daily basis to promote overall mindfulness. While traditional trackers can be hard to understand, simple graphs of the data can make it easier and quicker for participants to understand their progress. We are creating journals that can visualize a person’s statistical data based on their automated tracking data and their written tasks to help them adhere to their plans, habits, or goals.</p>
<p><strong>Access all planning and organizational tools in one place across multiple devices.</strong>
While bullet journals are intended to be a centralized organization tool, our design research showed that people wish for more convenient access to their journals when they do not have their physical planners. Adding a digital component makes journaling much more feasible, especially for people with busy schedules. We hope to expand upon the idea of having all planning and organizational information in one place by making the data accessible on all digital platforms.</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows a <strong>Smart Journal</strong>, which retains the physical pen-and-paper interaction from a journal while providing accessibility and data visualization through the cloud. Using this IoT device, journalists can write down their tasks, plans, reflections, and trackers on pre-designed templates. Using OCR, the journal ports information to the cloud and automatically processes that information to create a graphical visualization of their monthly data. The data is displayed on a page at the beginning of each monthly spread so that people can access all of their information in one journal.</p>

It provides participants a space to sit down and unwind, synchronize their files, visualize their progress towards their goals and habits, and reflect upon their day.</p>
<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards</h3>
<h4 id="selected-design">Selected Design</h4>
<p>We combined the ideas presented in the Smart Journal (Design 1) and app (Design 2) sketches to determine our design direction, and our focused tasks are taking time to be mindful and writing down tasks and thoughts (Task 3) and accessing organizational tools everywhere and across multiple devices (Task 6).</p>
<p>We chose a hybrid design, a smart journal that is compatible with a multi-platform app. This provides people with efficiency and convenience while still allowing for a tactile experience and interaction. Our research participants emphasized the importance of writing things down, but also mentioned the significant overhead required for tracking and staying motivated to achieve their goals. A physical form allows people to slow down and visualize their schedules, making it easier to say no to commitments they cannot take on. Especially with many journalists facing busy schedules, we hope to reduce the amount of procedural and mindless tasks that are often associated with tracking, to both encourage participants to find time to practice mindfulness in their routines, and to make journaling accessible on any platform. We hope that our Pocket Planner design will empower people to be more mindful of their mental health.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<h4 id="problem">Problem</h4>
<p>A recent study by <app-generated-link linkHREF="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7jx6z631">UC Berkeley</app-generated-link> showed that if one additional passenger was added to every 10 vehicles, 0.8 to 0.82 billion gallons of fuel could be saved annually in the U.S. This would also amount to a reduction of 7.2 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, facilitating carpools is not only a step in reducing the impact of climate change but also has numerous positive benefits for individual citizens such as cost savings and reduced traffic congestion.</p>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>Our solution comes in the form of an application that is centered on providing its users with a safe and convenient way to find suitable people to carpool with. Our research shows that there was an interest in finding both routine and one-off carpools as long as safety and convenience was prioritized. Our design will feature a matching system that factors in background checks and user ratings to ensure safety. Its focus will be to allow users to build a reliable network of people to carpool with as well as easily organize carpools with existing contacts.</p>
<h3 id="design-research">Design Research</h3>
<h4 id="goal">Goal</h4>
<p>As carpooling is a fairly common activity across all populations, we wanted to explore the different contexts of carpooling with a focus on user’s current transport experience, previous carpool relationships and what factors they consider the most important with regards to carpooling</p>
<h4 id="methods">Methods</h4>
<p>We used two methods, semi structured interviews and an online survey, to gather concrete findings for the direction of our design.</p>
<p><strong>Semi-Structured Interviews</strong></p>
<p>We chose to use semi-structured interviews as our primary method for conducting our research. This involved a thirty minute interview with participants which loosely followed a framework of questions centered around our focus. This gave us flexibility in asking follow up questions to explore the specifics around each participant’s context.</p>
<p><em>Interview Participants</em></p>
<p>Our participants were students and working professionals as they would be the most likely to have routine commutes. We wanted feedback from people who do not drive to ask questions about their concerns with finding someone to carpool.  We also wanted feedback from people with their own cars to ask about their concerns with sharing their car. Our specific participant backgrounds were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A working professional employed at the Columbia Tower in Downtown Seattle who buses to work</li>
<li>A working professional employed in a small clinic in Shoreline who drives to work</li>
<li>A university student who carpooled in highschool while living with a host family in Florida, where public transportation is not available.</li>
<li>A local university student who drives to school by herself</li>
<li>A working professional that bikes to and from work every day</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Online Survey</strong></p>
<p>The goal with our online survey was to gather feedback from a wide variety of contexts that we could not cover with our interviews. Our survey questions covered the same themes as our interviews but also allowed us to ask direct questions, such as whether they would be interested in our concept, without any biases due to the anonymous nature of our survey.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results-themes">Design Research Results &amp; Themes</h3>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/surveyresults.png" width="100%" style="float: right; max-width: 400px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>This tree graph shows the survey participants’ responses when asked about their three most important factors in carpooling. Highlighted in green are the four most common keywords: cost, friendliness, safety, and convenience. Through these results and the findings from the semi-structured interviews, we were able to develop two main focuses in our carpooling design.</p>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h4 id="safety">Safety</h4>
<p>Almost every participant in our design research study brought up safety as their main concern towards carpooling. The survey results showed that they were interested in having background checks and features like reviews and ratings to help ensure a thorough screening for each member in the carpooling community. Four of the five participants in the semi-structured interviews also suggested allowing users to choose their own preferences for their fellow carpoolers in order to set mutual understandings of the expectations they have towards each other. For example, one of the university students suggested drivers should clarify if smoking or eating in the car is allowed, and passengers can suggest extra compensation for missing or late drivers. In general, most wanted the ability to modify their own carpooling communities and avoid riding with strangers whenever possible. This increases the likelihood that the carpooling group have common interests and friendly, non-awkward conversations through this customized filtering process.</p>
<h4 id="coordination">Coordination</h4>
<p>The most frequently mentioned issue from our participants was the lack of proper coordination within the carpooling group. The participants from both research methods wanted live updates and locations of their drivers and a clear itinerary for the entire ride. In addition, scheduling was a major factor in this problem. Two of the working professionals in the semi-structured interviews explained that they do not want anyone in the group to have to wait or to adjust their schedules in order to create the carpool. They wanted some flexibility that is required for their work, especially for the clinic worker who needs to be at her workplace according to her patients’ needs. However, if it was not too inconvenient for everyone in the group, they are more than happy to carpool in order to save money and gas.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p><strong>Finding carpoolers with the same route</strong>. This task is focused on ensuring that people are actually willing to carpool together. Almost all cases of carpooling that our participants partook in were when the carpoolers had a similar or identical destination. Intuitively, it is hard to motivate people to carpool if they must go out of their way to pick others up. As such, making sure the routes of the carpoolers are compatible is a high priority for our design.</p>
<p><strong>Communicating the location and status of the carpool</strong>. This task was motivated by the participants indicating that scheduling and waiting for transportation were major pain points for them. This issue exists in other forms of transportation as well, such as public transit, shuttle buses, and rideshare services. Thus, we want our design to minimize the amount of waiting done by the carpoolers.</p>
<p><strong>Finding the most efficient routes</strong>. Several participants mentioned they had difficulty coordinating carpools with multiple passengers, which involve several pick-up and drop-off locations. A design that can find the most efficient route will help alleviate this barrier.</p>
<p><strong>Finding a community with shared preferences</strong>. Our participants had many different preferences when it came to carpooling. Cleanliness, driving speed, and talkativity are some examples of factors people consider when carpooling with others. By matching carpoolers that share similar preferences, we increase the chance of people will carpool together again in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring driving behaviors to ensure the safety of carpoolers</strong>. Safety was a chief concern among the vast majority of our participants, and we wanted our design to give people peace of mind when carpooling.</p>
<p><strong>Seeing money/C02 emissions saved from carpooling</strong>. The practical benefits of carpooling was a main motivating for many of our participants. For instance, one university student we interviewed mentioned they carpooled to reduce parking costs. By clearly showing these benefits to people, we can motivate them to carpool more frequently.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches</h3>
<h4 id="design-1-finding-new-people-to-carpool-with">Design 1: Finding New People to Carpool With</h4>
<p>The focus of this design is to help users find reliable people to carpool with. When adding a carpool, a user can choose their destination, set their schedule and edit their preferences. They will then be given a list of possible users that match their route, schedule, and preferences. Each match will be displayed as a profile with their description, driver rating, route, and preferences on a card. The user can choose to send a request to the carpool to the match. If the recipient of the request accepts then they can communicate with each other in a chat. New users can also be added to the group if approved by both parties. The user’s profile page also includes a summary of how much money they have saved through carpooling in comparison to driving solo as well as how much they have reduced their carbon emissions to motivate further carpooling.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/3design_find_people.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="design-2-gamification">Design 2: Gamification</h4>
<p>This design is centered around gamification and creating a competitive environment to encourage people to carpool more frequently. The design will feature a way to create and join groups, which can be based on this such as workplace, city, etc. The groups will have a leaderboard of people that have participated the most in carpooling. This grouping will allow people to find others that share something in common with them, which would help expand a person’s network of people to carpool with. The design also features a statistics page for people to track various carpooling stats, as well as a badge system for reaching certain achievements.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/3design_gamification.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="design-3-connected-car-service">Design 3: Connected Car Service</h4>
<p>This designed platform is intended for the duration of the riding experience, which assumes that the carpooling group has already formed. By inputting the addresses of each passenger’s pick up point, it can determine the best way to arrange the pick-up points for the most efficient routes. It also allows for easy access to directions on the road and communication to passengers. This is particularly important in situations when there are unexpected delays or schedule changes while on the road. Moreover, It includes the ‘Passengers’ feature for specific passenger information. To facilitate the in-car activities, the “Music” feature allows all passengers to add their own choice of music onto the music queue in the car through their own devices.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/3design_incar.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards</h3>
<p>In the end, we chose to pursue our first design centered around “finding and matching individuals”. Matching passengers and drivers that share the same preferences provide a feeling of safety and comfort, which is a feature that is desired by an overwhelming number of our research participants. By allowing users to provide feedback for their past trips, whether it be by ratings, reviews, or other methods, it informs other users about people they are going to ride with. Moreover, many participants see heavy traffic and missing bus schedules as pain points of their current transportation method, which is another main focus of our first design, helping users communicate a reliable yet flexible schedule and provide timely updates.</p>
<p>Some problems that we found with the “gamification design” are that it focused too heavily on routine carpools around a specific community, and not as much on one-off events, or for small friend groups.  It also assumes that there is a community or group that the user is already interested in joining, and does not help with finding or matching individuals. Our main concern for the “in-car experience design” is the lack of focus for this aspect of carpooling during user research. This results in not having as much time or information to help direct our design. However, we believe that there are elements of these designs that we can incorporate in our main design. For example, features like badge/achievement will help motivating users to carpool more frequently. With the in-car design, we can think of screens and interfaces that can make the actual carpooling experience better.</p>
<h4 id="task-1-finding-suitable-carpoolers">Task 1 - Finding Suitable Carpoolers</h4>
<p>Our user research overwhelmingly showed that people wanted to know their carpooling group first before the carpooling experience. Rather than random strangers, they would like to have a network of reliable passengers through filtering or background checks for security. When asked the most important factor when deciding to carpool with someone, almost every participant mentioned “comfortability with other passengers”, “relationship”, and “reliability”. This is why we chose to center around this task based on finding suitable carpoolers. When the user creates an account, they will be asked to fill out their preferences for people they would like to carpool with. Then based on their preferences and schedules, they will then be able to find recommended carpoolers that share the same preferences. For example, the system will not match a rider who often eats in the car with a driver who cares a lot about their car’s cleanliness.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/storyboard1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="task-2-communicating-live-updates">Task 2 - Communicating Live Updates</h4>
<p>Most of our research participants mentioned that delays and unexpected scheduling changes were the main problems with their carpooling experiences. We wanted to make sure this is included in our design as our targeted participants of students and working professionals mentioned that schedule changes and road-related delays were common. Before a trip starts, the driver will receive a personalizable notification regarding the start time of the carpool. When the driver starts to drive, the riders then will be able to receive notification regarding the current location of the driver and the estimated arrival time. Based on their settings, they will also be able to receive multiple notifications/messages regarding the trip status. In the best situation, all users will then be able to arrive on time. This task is especially useful in emergent cases, such as lateness, heavy traffic etc. By allowing the users to see the drivers/rider’s location and keep updating, this design helps facilitate communication and avoid conflicts.</p>

<h3 id="id-1-problem-and-solution-overview">1. Problem and Solution Overview</h3>
<p>There exists an implicit onboarding process in specialized fields of work. Not only is there a standard training process for new employees, there is a second, hidden one as well. This hidden process is the understanding of technical jargon in that field, especially in professional contexts. Our problem is how do we speed up this process, or, in other words, how do we get people to master sophisticated and specialized jargons and information in professional industries at a quicker pace. Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 176,000 jobs every month in 2019. The expanding workforce and relentless onboarding that occurs for professionals exacerbates this problem.</p>
<p>Our solution to the problem lies in utilizing continuous speech capture technology. People can track their own speech as well as those of their colleagues to better understand technical jargon and integrate it into their own speech. The solution is a wearable app pair: There is a feature on a smartwatch paired with a smartphone app. The primary purpose of the wearable is for speech capture when prompted, and the smartphone app offers insights, analysis, and ways to improve their vernacular, both through understanding new words and eventually using those words in their specialized field.</p>
<h3 id="id-2-design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">2. Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants</h3>
<p>The focus of our design research was on gaining a deeper understanding of what conversational issues people new to a certain professional environment face, and what they do to overcome it, so that we can use continuous speech capture to assist with the process.</p>
<p>We considered many different approaches to carry out or research, ultimately deciding to conduct interviews. This made sense because it allowed us to provide participants with a safe environment to articulate and comfortably discuss the problems they face on a daily basis in natural language, a highly personal topic.</p>
<p>Our design should be versatile enough so that it can be used by people in any profession, regardless of their niche. In other words, we want to be able to help not only beginner computer scientists, but also amateur plumbers. In an effort to cover this wide spectrum, we decided to interview an art student, a lawyer, a biology student, and a business student.</p>
<p>Initially, we were also concerned about technical communication across different languages, for example a German-speaking and Hindi-speaking mathematician trying to communicate at some conference, and finding a solution for that as well. However, after the first couple interviews, we discovered that this wasn’t a big problem, a finding supported by a lot of our secondary research, and so pivoted away from trying to solve any translational problems.</p>
<h3 id="id-3-design-research-results-and-themes">3. Design Research Results and Themes</h3>
<p>Despite the vastly different background of each research participant, many common needs and practices came up, allowing us to critically breakdown and identify common opportunities. A fundamental pain point for everyone was the difficulty they faced in understanding the technical lingo of an environment they were new to, and expanding their knowledge base, and then subsequently incorporating all of this in their own speech.</p>
<p><strong>People initially had trouble comprehending the sophisticated jargon unique to their specific environment.</strong> A young art student spoke about the challenges she faced, saying &quot;There are literally thousands of different technical adjectives in art, and you have to know exactly how each one is different from another while critiquing, which really caused me problems when I was a newbie artist.&quot; Similar frustrations were expressed by all our participants.</p>
<p><strong>The issue of collecting new information from intellectual discussions with peers in their respective fields was also universally expressed across all our participants.</strong> &quot;Very often, in meetings with my boss, I would still be fully processing something he said earlier, and so miss out on some crucial information he said later on&quot;, exasperated the business student.</p>
<p><strong>The process of incorporating technical lingo consistently in your own everyday speech is rather slow.</strong> Even after our participants felt like they got the hang of the workplace vernacular, their own speech was still not professional enough by some standards, and had room for improvement. &quot;It took me awhile to start using technical words and ideas in the lab confidently, and in the correct context. The process was slow, and in hindsight, I wish I had some help speeding it up&quot;. This desire to 'sound smart' in front of their peers was similarly expressed across all our interviews.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, people were also seemingly curious about similarities and differences in their speech among different settings of daily conversation.</strong> &quot;I would love to gain a better understanding of how I talk differently at work and at home. What are the things I say to clients, and what are the things I say to my grandma. I wonder if there are some specific words I use a lot in some situations but not in others.&quot; said the lawyer we interviewed. A similar curiosity was found even in some other participants.
These were the results that came out of our design research process.</p>
<h3 id="id-4-identified-tasks">4. Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>We have summarized main pain points that were mentioned during interviews with our potential targets as well as from our initial design research. After analyzing our research and interview results, we designed 6 tasks that embody the objectives our targets want to accomplish and particular needs they have.</p>
<p><strong>Task 1: Identify and compile new terms and vocabulary.</strong> Four interviewees all expressed their concerns to quickly comprehend and extract important terms in fast-paced intellectual discussions. Hence, we think it is fairly important to design this task to help our potential target identify and organize new terms and vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2: Review and study identified vocabulary.</strong> The majority of our interviewees, when being asked about memorizing new terms and keywords, told us that they have to force themselves to review and memorize them constantly, otherwise they will quickly forget those words completely.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3: Integrate vocabulary into daily conversations.</strong> Although all of our interviewees acknowledged that remembering and integrating newly-gathered information into their speech is a natural process, they worried that the entire process is too slow to be practical without any external forces. They also identified that they constantly find it difficult to naturally incorporate those words to appropriate contexts when talking with other professionals.</p>
<p><strong>Task 4: Identify places for improvements.</strong> In our design research, we noticed that a lot of our interviewees, even though they have spent time reviewing and extracting important information, they always lack a clear goal to enhance and hone their skills, not sure where they are and where they are heading to. This makes their effort less effective and leaves it in vain.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5: Reflect on changes and progress.</strong>  Through our design research, we discovered that incentivizing and personalizing learning experience triggers powerful human emotions, particularly fulfillment, encouragement and interests. Reinforcing good behaviors and improvements by offering small, staged rewards, even small psychological rewards, can help users accomplish their goals one by one and create a sense of achievement for them to proceed further. According to the statistics demonstrated by TalentLMS [1], 81% of respondents said that the reward system increases their engagement and gives them encouragement for future learning.</p>
<p><strong>Task 6: Draw connections among different settings of daily conversations</strong>. Throughout our interviews with our potential target users, we noticed that people have particular need to &quot;translate&quot; speeches in their professional areas to speeches aiming for people without professional knowledge. As our interviewees mentioned, every time before conversations, they need to spend a long time thinking carefully about how to use plain language to properly communicate in front of people outside their industry but always fail to achieve this by unconsciously assuming other people understand what he/she is talking about with professional languages.</p>
<h3 id="id-5-proposed-design-sketches">5. Proposed Design Sketches</h3>
<p><strong>Design 1: Wearable - Mobile Learning App Pair</strong></p>
<p>This wearable-mobile app pair especially focuses on collecting new information from conversations and learning the newly-gathered information.Learners can tap the record button on the wearable screen to start recording and stop the recording by tapping again. The recording will then be analyzed, jargons from this field will be presented in a manner that is easy to comprehend and memorize, integrating methods such as relational diagrams, flashcards and quizzes. Meaning, frequency of the words mentioned, and common usage will be presented if one clicks the word bubble. Playbacks of each word are also provided for the learner to get a sense of the context the new words are used. See <em>Figure.1</em> below for details.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 1: Wearable-Learning App Pair</b></p>
<p><strong>Design 2: Speech Improvement Mobile App</strong></p>
<p>The speech improvement mobile app is more focused on helping people learn how to use words in the correct context and tracking their every step along the speech improvement journey. The design of the app combines the idea of personal training apps and Grammarly. Users can build a profile, provide the information on their current fluency in their areas, and what they wish to achieve. A timeline will then be generated for the users to present a clear visualization of their speech improvement journey. The users can tap the record button on the lower menu to start recording. The written version of their speech will be presented on the speech, there will also be suggestions on some words or framing of sentences to make the speech more appropriate in the given context. The advice may come from the speech of professionals that the users talk to, or external sources. Details are given in <em>Figure.2</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 2: Speech Improvement Mobile App</b></p>
<p><strong>Design 3: Wearable and Audio Analysis on Desktop</strong></p>
<p>The wearable is specifically designed and equipped with audio recording capability. Users are able to proactively activate the audio recording by pressing the start button on the wearable and stop recording at any time by pressing the button again. The audio then will be sent to and analyzed on the registered PC or Mac securely. All related and emphasized topics will be extracted from the audio clips and listed on the front page by their frequency and importance. This allows users to quickly pinpoint the topic/area they want to review afterwards. Each topic includes a keyword list and a corresponding list of brief summaries according to the fields, realms that users select. By clicking the keyword, the user is able to review playbacks in which the keyword is mentioned as well as other tangible related materials.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 3: Wearable and Audio Analysis on Desktop</b></p>
<h3 id="id-6-selected-design-and-storyboards">6. Selected Design and Storyboards</h3>
<p>We chose to combine the second design and third design. Together, these two designs address a majority of goals we identified from our participants: pinpointing new terms and vocabularies, reviewing and getting familiarized with those new words/info and evaluating their progress. The combined design contains a wearable to support audio recording as well as a smartphone for data presentation. Smartphones make analysis and reflection on those captured data much easier, and wearable allows for a less intrusive method of continuous speech capture. From our design research, most of our participants tend to become rusty on certain words as time goes by. The combined design aims to facilitate learning and proactively reactive memory in the correct context.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Compiling New Terms/Vocabulary and Review the Identified Words</strong></p>
<p>Peter is a new lawyer, and the conferences and hearings he needs to attend are always lengthy. Even though there are always audio recordings, it is time-consuming to listen to the entire recording aimlessly to gather the most instructive information. He wants to quickly capture the keywords and juristic theories so that he is able to draw some parallels from them. After researching online, he decided to give Procabulary a shot. On the other day, he recorded the hearing that he attended using his smart watch. The material was then transferred to ProCabulary and analyzed thoroughly. A brief summary of the court hearing, and a list of extracted keywords were presented in the app. The order of the keyword list was based on the frequency those words were mentioned, and he can check out the definition, common usage, and playback audios of the mentioned keywords. Peter was glad that he discovered ProCabulary, for it could not only save him tons of time going through the lengthy recordings, but also help him capture those keywords with ease.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 4: Storyboard for Scenario 1</b></p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Identifying Places for Improvement and Track One’s Progress</strong></p>
<p>Jason is a Ph.D. student who majors in transportation engineering, but he wants to pursue a career in the consulting industry. As a non-native speaker, he finds the transition to be quite challenging. A friend highly recommended him try out ProCabulary to improve his speech, so he purchased the premium plan. He set up his profile, specifying his current fluency in consulting, and his goal (to sound like a professional consultant). The other day, Jason recorded the conversation with a client by using the recording app on his apple watch. What he said during the meeting was extracted and presented in ProCabulary. Several suggestions regarding his word choice were provided, for example, &quot;I'm available &quot; to be rephrased as &quot;I will have bandwidth to take on this project,&quot; and &quot;get the senior person engaged in my idea&quot; be replaced by &quot;gain traction.&quot; With the advice provided by ProCabulary, Jason's speech became more appropriate for the consulting setting. Jason was glad that he could find a tool that helps him incorporate the consulting glossary into his language.</p>

<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview:</h3>
<p>In general, people love to look back on memories and experiences whether it brings them a sense of joy and nostalgia, allows them to set goals for the future, or provides a way to process emotions. However, many times, reminiscing proactively seems difficult. Some people struggle to keep journals regularly and others feel like they do not reflect effectively.</p>
<p>The solution to these difficulties should allow for proactive, timely, and convenient forms of reminiscing. The intent is to allow users to get a beneficial experience no matter how much time they choose to dedicate to reflection. Additionally, users should have the choice of reminiscing with the forms they want, in the way they want, and at the time they want. Our design strives to achieve these goals by providing a web platform that acts as a scrapbook to combine physical and digital media of various forms to record a snapshot of one’s days and memories.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants:</h3>
<p>Our design research was conducted to help us understand how and why people reminisce and find any pain-points in the process. Some of the questions we focused on include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How often do people journal?</li>
<li>What forms do people use to remember and reminisce?</li>
<li>What are the major pain points with journaling?</li>
<li>What do people like to remember?</li>
<li>What do people not like to remember?</li>
<li>Do people prefer physical or digital mediums for journaling?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our research methods included a survey and three interviews. We chose to conduct a survey because we thought it would give us a broader picture and show us general trends across a population of individuals who do and do not journal. Additionally, as the survey was released before the interviews, it helped us develop better interview questions. We posted the survey on several social media accounts in addition to sending it to peers and family. All responses were made anonymous unless the participant was willing to be contacted for a follow-up interview. Next, we interviewed three random participants at the UW Bookstore and the UW Allen Library. We decided that reminiscing is a fairly universal task and thus wanted to choose relatively random participants to both reflect that and to get a diverse set of opinions. Initially, we had also considered doing a diary study to learn more and test out different forms of journaling, namely free-form vs. prompted journaling. However, after analyzing our survey results, we found that people overwhelmingly prefered free-form journaling and that there could be privacy concerns with collecting participants' entries, so we decided not to proceed with the diary study.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research Results and Themes:</h3>
<p>In the survey, we received 30 responses, many from college students but also some from the age group 50 and up. The survey was beneficial for quantitative data and visualizing overall trends. One main take away was that the majority of participants have an interest in starting to journal or already journal. Additionally, participants like to reminisce prominently through digital media, like music, photos, and shared memories on social media. To quote one respondent,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I find music to be the most effective method as when listening to songs they take me back to very specific moments of my life”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, we found that the majority of people that do some form of journaling value the physical form of the journal for its authentic feeling, however, there were still those who prefer digital, for its convenience.</p>
<p>In our interviews we collected 3 unique opinions on reminiscing. The first two interviews were conducted at Allen Library. The first participant communicated that journaling felt like a daunting task. Thus, she reminisced through photos and reflective writing assignments from her coursework. She also mentioned that she would want to journal if it was easier. From the second participant, we learned that journaling in both physical and digital writing is useful; he used Microsoft Word and his physical journal for different tasks. For the final interview, we targeted the UW Bookstore’s diary and journal section in attempt to find a participant with direct interest in journaling. Our third participant used journaling as a form of goal-setting. He liked to make action items and goals from his daily reflections in his digital journal so he could act on those the next day.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks:</h3>
<p>To decide on our tasks we drew on insights from both the survey and the interviews. We wanted to create tasks that allow each individual to reminisce in the way they want whether it is in a digital or physical form. The six tasks we identified were the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Going back through old media, such as photo albums, to reminisce.</strong></em>
In our survey, we saw that people enjoyed looking back on various forms of media to help them reminisce. For example, our first interview participant said she would like to record her memories with photos so she could look back on them for a better picture of the memory.</li>
<li><em><strong>Evaluating memories and actively highlighting “more valuable” ones.</strong></em>
This task arose from the fact that many participants recognized a difference between proactive and passive reflection. In the survey, several responses indicated that reminiscing on certains memories can be detrimental or painful. Because of this, we wanted the users of our design to be able to choose what memories are valuable to them to look back on.</li>
<li><em><strong>Recording in a journal as a way to process thoughts and emotions.</strong></em>
In our survey, many cited their reason for journaling as “a way to organize thoughts/feelings and make difficult decisions easier” and “to process some of the emotions I was having”. Writing can be a form of therapy and help people work out things which are complicated to keep track of mentally.</li>
<li><em><strong>Drawing insights and making goals pertaining to social experiences from recordings.</strong></em>
Journaling and reminiscing is often done out of a desire to understand one’s self better and, in most cases, to improve. It also, when done consistently, allows for a tracking of behaviors in day-to-day life and an observance of trends. Combining this desire for improvement with the tracking that journaling provides results in goal-setting, which we felt was a task was one our design should support.</li>
<li><em><strong>Regular intervals of recording everyday life in a journal</strong></em>
Memories are made up of facts. Without recording the context and detail of a memory—such as the who, the where, and the when— reflecting and subsequently setting goals is practically impossible. Thus, we felt that this task was of utmost importance to address in our design, as it supported all the others.</li>
<li><em><strong>Sharing past memories and accompanying thoughts with friends</strong></em>
Some of the best memories are the ones made with those we love. The desire to revisit memories and then share them was an experience that was mentioned in both our interviews and our surveys and thus one that we felt was important to consider with our design.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches:</h3>
<h4 id="physical-digital-interface">Physical + Digital Interface</h4>
<p>This design would involve a combination of smart physical devices as well as an online platform to collect memories from both the digital and physical realm, bridging the gap so that people are able to enjoy the benefits of digital convenience, while retaining the charm of physical experiences. By combining the two forms of medium you retain the authenticity and therapeutic nature of writing in a journal, but the digital complement allows for speed, which addresses many peoples’ concern of journaling taking too much time, as well as sharing and searching options, amongst other features that a physical book simply cannot provide on its own.</p>

<h4 id="online-app-that-centralizes-media-and-digital-presence">Online App that Centralizes Media and Digital Presence</h4>
<p>This design would be an online platform that grabs data from different services a user is a part of to provide a comprehensive overview of memories in different formats. For example, it might use the Facebook API and Spotify API to generate a scrapbook of your recent trip to Europe, combining the posts and photos you shared along with the music you listened to during your vacation. The goal of this design is to curate a digital snapshot using data that already exists, thus providing a lot of information in a much shorter amount of time.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/idea2_api.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="A drawing of our idea for an app that centralizes media and digital presence by connecting to different media platforms such as Spotify, Instagram, Facebook, or Google Photos to combine different mediums of memories together."></p>
<h4 id="customizable-physical-journal">Customizable Physical Journal</h4>
<p>This design is aimed to help people who want to start journaling or those that have some dissatisfaction with their physical journaling experience. It allows people to collect memories in a physical form but opens further flexibility as the journaling can change formats as they write and have the freedom to modify their journals as they see fit. This design is meant to accommodate and celebrate the really individual and personal nature of journaling, and provides people an opportunity to experiment with and curate a journal that works best for them.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/idea3_customizablejournal.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="A drawing of our Customizable Physical Journal idea that depicts a physical ring journal which can have pages inserted into it. Users can go online to select or design their own page layouts/prompts, and print them out to be inserted into their own journals."></p>
<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards:</h3>
<p>We decided to go with a combination of our Physical + Digital Interface idea as well as our API idea because the two together seemed to best address the three core goals of our project: recording, reminiscing, and reflecting. The Physical + Digital Interface idea directly connected to two of our research insights, that there are advantages to both physical and digital, as well as addressing the pain point of recording being time consuming. On the other hand, we felt that the API idea had better connection to another key idea, that people use different forms to reminisce, from music to photos. We decided that both could be incorporated into a single design, without adding too much complexity or detracting from each other. We also decided that the physical components of the Physical + Digital Interface idea, such as the smart pen or scanner, would add a cost barrier which would limit the number of potential users, and its functionality could easily be replaced by a smartphone camera which is more convenient. Ultimately, this combination of the two ideas becomes something which more resembles what we like to refer to as a “digital scrapbook”. We think that this can particularly help address the tasks of daily recording and evaluating memories to find those that are more valuable.</p>
<h4 id="storyboard-1">Storyboard 1</h4>
<p>This storyboard demonstrates how our design supports the task of recording everyday life. Based on the results of our research we realized that writing in a physical journal is an important way to do such recording, but not the only way. A written account provides only part of the full picture, which is why the digital component of our design also incorporates things such as music and photos. As shown, Greg returns from a long day and writes about the concert he attended but struggles to come up with much more to write. However, he realizes that there was more to his day than he is able to effectively articulate on paper, so he uses the digital component to curate a more complete picture. Remi-nice helped him more easily record his memories in a meaningful way.</p>

<h4 id="storyboard-2">Storyboard 2</h4>
<p>The task of evaluating memories with intent to highlight more valuable ones and filter unhelpful ones is of vital importance, as shown by our research. While reminiscing is an activity most take part in, there is a fine line between it being an effective means to revisit the past and a gateway to unnecessary dwelling. In this storyboard we demonstrate how Sally had a mostly good day, having done well on her exam and gotten lunch with her friend, but got into a small argument with her mother. However, although she writes about all of those events in her physical journal, she realizes that when she revisits her digital scrapbook she would rather focus on the positives, and thus only uploads what she chooses to.</p>

<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview:</h3>
<p>Studying is a universal struggle shared amongst students everywhere.  When completing their coursework, students have to juggle meeting deadlines, preventing burnout, avoiding distractions, measuring their own knowledge of their coursework, and aiming for solid grades.  Unfortunately, the fact that there is no universal best way to study makes this challenge even more difficult to solve.  Also, technology is now often used in curriculums across all disciplines.  Since technology (and more specifically, the internet) also can be a great distraction to students, for many students it can be incredibly difficult to manage staying on track when studying with tech-based resources.</p>
<p>Stud-e is a personalized study advisor app, using data recorded from past study sessions to help optimize students’ study session time usage.  Stud-e does so via tracking study sessions, recording students’ progress via either passive digital tool integration (i.e. Canvas) or actively surveying the student about their own progress after the completion of a study session.  It then references this data to provide feedback.  During future study sessions, stud-e actively provides guidance on how to best optimize students’ study time through an app-connected bracelet that guides users based upon productivity estimates derived from the collected data to take breaks, resume studying, or conclude their studies for the day.  The data is also compiled, analyzed, and stored in an easy-to-read format so that each student can observe how productive he/she was in prior sessions and consciously learn how to improve upon his/her past study habits.  Lastly, stud-e can block access to recorded distractions from breaks or unproductive sessions to prevent students from getting too off track in their studies.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants:</h3>
<p>In doing our research, our goal was to gain insight into the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which study habits are associated students with a good GPA/successful students.</li>
<li>Different types of study habits.</li>
<li>How people track their productivity.</li>
<li>Good/bad study environments.</li>
<li>Desired features in a study habits-improvement tool.</li>
<li>Break-taking habits.</li>
<li>How students deal with distractions.</li>
<li>How students allocate time for studies.</li>
<li>How much of the average student’s coursework is physical and how much is digital.</li>
</ul>
<p>By learning about the above, we would better be able to design a product around the needs of students that works within the limitations provided by their busy lives.</p>
<p>To complete our research, we completed structured interviews with six different participants spread across various ages, majors, levels of education, and gender.  We chose to do interviews as our study method since we (correctly) assumed that each student has their own unique study habits and that an interview format would be the most effective and efficient way to learn about them.  We made the interviews structured to somewhat standardize our results.  While we originally considered doing contextual inquiries as well, we could not figure out a way to do so without either messing up the results by making the participant aware of our presence or being creepy by telling a participant that we had been observing them without them knowing for an extended period of time.  To find interviewees, we both interviewed participants in Odegaard Library and interviewed friends we knew personally.  We did this since random interviewees may be more honest in their results, and familiar interviewees may care more about their answers and therefore be willing to go more in-depth about them.  Below is a quick overview of the demographics of each of the participants we interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andrew - 2nd Year CS Student interviewed at Odegaard Library.</li>
<li>John - 1st Year CS Student interviewed at Odegaard Library</li>
<li>Christopher - 2nd Year Undeclared Student intending to major in Physics interviewed at residence</li>
<li>Robert - 3rd Year Supply Chain/Business Student interviewed at residence</li>
<li>James - UW Class of 2019 Alumni in Biochemistry studying for MCATs interviewed in Tacoma</li>
<li>Pallavi - 2nd Year Business Student interviewed at residence</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research Results and Themes:</h3>
<p>In the end, our research was incredibly successful.  Across our participants, we received a diverse range of responses to each of our questions, providing us with a dataset from which we derived the following three themes:</p>
<h4 id="there-is-no-universal-best-way-to-study"><em>There is no universal “best way to study.”</em></h4>
<p>Across participants, the “best way to study” varied wildly;  in fact, some participants’ “best” ways to study were near-identical to others’ “worst” ways to study.  For example:  Christopher thrives on studying with friends from other classes, while Robert and James explicitly stated that they do poorly in those environments.  Some participants never take breaks (James, John), while others take breaks somewhat often (Robert, Andrew).  The discrepancies found between our participants’ study habits in our research indicate that whatever solution we come up with must tailor to the individual in some way.  This meant designing something that learns and informs what does/does not work for an individual from recording their study habits.</p>
<h4 id="studying-in-groups-is-often-desirable-but-can-go-poorly-for-a-litany-of-reasons"><em>Studying in groups is often desirable, but can go poorly for a litany of reasons.</em></h4>
<p>Not a single participant interviewed explicitly said that they did not want to study with others for a personal reason.  Some, in fact, reflected upon having extremely positive prior study experiences with other students.  However, all participants mentioned that group study sessions can be hard since a whole group can be distracted more easily than an individual.  James even mentioned that the amount of time often spent having to bridge the gaps in knowledge between participants deters him from studying in groups.  In our solution, we would need to tackle these issues of group distraction and comprehension.</p>
<h4 id="the-internet-is-both-a-requirement-to-complete-work-and-a-major-source-of-distractions"><em>The internet is both a requirement to complete work and a major source of distractions.</em></h4>
<p>All participants noted that their coursework most often requires a digital aspect, usually involving the internet.  Most participants mentioned websites and internet-based apps as a source of breaks and distractions as well.  The requirement of using the internet makes it a distracting temptation impossible to turn off.  Our solution would have to be able to help participants manage and focus their internet usage in a way that minimizes distractions and maximizes productivity during their study sessions.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks:</h3>
<p>After reflecting upon our design research interview transcripts and themes, we came up with the following potential tasks for our project:</p>
<h4 id="id-1-details-regarding-the-user-s-study-habits-are-recorded-and-used-to-generate-feedback-on-how-to-maximize-their-study-time"><em>1. Details regarding the user’s study habits are recorded and used to generate feedback on how to maximize their study time</em></h4>
<p>When interviewing students, it became apparent that time management and scheduling were common tasks across the interviewed students.  For example, Pallavi noted that she has to juggle events for her business fraternity, studying, doing chores, hanging out with friends, and more.  Since she has to schedule day-to-day events, she’d like to know what time of the day would be best for her to study most productively.  She noted that her focus varies depending on what point she is at in her day:  during some hours of the day, she is more distracted than others.  As a result, she ends up spending a lot of time trying to fit in studying whenever she has free time.  Obviously, this is less than optimal, so we decided our project could pursue this task.</p>
<h4 id="id-2-journaling-data-about-a-particular-study-session"><em>2. Journaling data about a particular study session</em></h4>
<p>Although gathering data may be useful in accomplishing our project’s goals, the collected data also can provide value to the user. For instance, when our design reports to the user for what percentage of study time they tend to spend productively, the user will be able to use that in the future to better estimate how much time he/she should allocate to accomplish a given study-related task. Metadata we believe our users would find useful for a given study session include: total time spent, time spent productively, time spent distracted, which apps or websites were accessed the most when distracted, when the session started, where the session took place, who else was present, and how productive the session subjectively felt to the user.</p>
<h4 id="id-3-coordinating-and-making-group-study-time-as-productive-as-possible"><em>3. Coordinating and making group study time as productive as possible</em></h4>
<p>As mentioned in the theme-section above, no participant explicitly said that he/she was opposed to studying with others.  However, John, Christopher, and James all described instances where studying in a group actively detracted from their productivity.  For John and Christopher, one member in each of their study groups managed to derail the whole groups’ studying efforts.  For James, one group member’s competency in the curriculum was below the rest, so everyone was stuck teaching him in order to get him caught up on the materials.  In all cases, one group member burned through valuable study time.  We decided to look into having our project tackle this task in order to help allow for more-productive group work.</p>
<h4 id="id-4-managing-and-tracking-appropriate-breaks"><em>4. Managing and tracking appropriate breaks</em></h4>
<p>Taking breaks is key to a successful study session, so it was pretty unfortunate when we found that students often mismanaged their breaks.  James, for example, studies for extremely long, continual periods without breaks due to the little study time he has, leading to burnout.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, Christopher would take breaks that often overstayed their welcome, leading to nothing getting done at all.  Thus, he typically decides to take very few.  Since taking a study break to refresh yourself is key to student success, we decided to pursue creating a solution that manages suggesting and providing optimal breaks for students.</p>
<h4 id="id-5-alerting-users-when-they-ve-been-not-productive-distracted-for-too-long"><em>5. Alerting users when they’ve been not productive/distracted for too long</em></h4>
<p>As mentioned in the previous task, some students (such as Christopher), take a break and get distracted for far too long.  This (obviously) results in getting very little done over a very long period of time.  This very obviously detracts from student productivity, so we decided that our project should probably pursue this task by keeping track of the nature and length of the breaks students are taking.</p>
<h4 id="id-6-managing-to-do-lists-and-tracking-progress"><em>6. Managing to-do lists and tracking progress</em></h4>
<p>When interviewed, Pallavi noted that she often struggles to stay on topic during study sessions, mostly due to the fact that she feels overwhelmed with different, multi-component-based tasks. She wishes there was a way for her to systematically track and visualize her progress on all the different tasks she was working on. She believes that having a better way to track her productivity and using it will keep her more engaged with the content she is working on. Additionally, John noted that he uses many of the current applications that are out there to manage to-do lists and track his progress, but he doesn’t feel “motivated” to continue using them after a short period of time. With a simple yet effective way to manage to-do lists and track progress, he believes that he will be more inclined to stick with these tools, thereby improving his productivity.  Based off of these two interviews, we decided that the task of managing and tracking progress in coursework would be integral to our final product.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches</h3>
<p>With the research process complete and some key functionalities laid out before us, it was time to begin brainstorming. Ultimately we produced three distinct designs, each with a different idea at its core. First, there was the self-journaling design, which emphasized user-provided, qualitative data. Second was the group study design, which was all about helping people collaborate productively. Then last we had our automated design which centered around making the process of studying as simple as possible for the user.</p>
<h4 id="design-1-journaling"><em>Design 1: Journaling</em></h4>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/design1.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>This first design is a mobile application that stores information collected from the user about their previous study sessions. As soon as a user finishes studying for the day, they would fill out a short questionnaire concerning the session and how certain factors affected their productivity. This questionnaire would be centered around collecting data that is subjective to the user, thus capturing information that no automatic process running in the background could.</p>
<p>Questions of this type include:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a scale from 1-to-5 how productive did this session feel to you?</li>
<li>On a scale from 1-to-5 how much stress were you feeling when you started studying and how much are you feeling now?</li>
<li>Are you happy with how this session turned out?  Why or why not?</li>
<li>Do you feel some part of the environment played a positive or negative role in your ability to focus?</li>
<li>Were other people around you?  If so, how do you feel they affected your productivity?</li>
</ul>
<p>The responses to these questions would then be logged for future reference for the user, in hopes of creating a sense of mindfulness. Our research tells us that the simple act of considering questions like those above can allow the user to gain insight about themselves that they wouldn’t otherwise.  Users may realize things such as:  “Wow, whenever I study in the library I end up putting a one or two down for my productivity, maybe I should stick to studying in my room!”</p>
<p>Other features this designs supports include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple to-do list program</li>
<li>Logging the length and frequency of breaks</li>
<li>A place to record miscellaneous notes about every session</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="design-2-collaboration"><em>Design 2: Collaboration</em></h4>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/design2.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>This design was envisioned as a desktop program with a mobile companion, and as stated above, it was all about helping groups coordinate study plans and work in tandem. This began by supporting a feature often neglected in other collaboration tools, helping groups of users find common openings in their schedules. Upon creating a new group activity in the app, users would have entered in their contact information as well as what days and times they'd be available. Once all group members had done so, our design would then identify times in which every schedule was simultaneously open and then recommend study sessions in such times.</p>
<p>Once in a study session, our design offers embedded Skype integration for those who need to work together remotely and/or need screen-sharing functionality. The app would also monitor which websites users visit and check them against a list of those deemed unproductive. If a user is unproductive for too long their name will turn red on everyone else’s screen and the gentle nudge of peer pressure would hopefully get them back on track.</p>
<p>Other features this designs supports include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coordinating overlapping breaks among group members.</li>
<li>Logging and reporting how much time each user spent productively in a given session.</li>
<li>Identifying individuals who are especially distracting to the group and politely asking them to get back on task.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="design-3-automation"><em>Design 3: Automation</em></h4>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/chosen-design.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>For our third design, we have a mobile app connecting to a computer for  dual functionality. Studying can be a tedious and mentally-draining process, so the goal of this design is to reduce the user's mental load as much as possible. One of the features in this design that best exemplifies this philosophy is our automatic to-do list and planner system. Stud-e can be linked to Canvas to find information regarding a user’s academic schedule such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the user’s class schedule look like?</li>
<li>When and where are upcoming tests and other academic events?</li>
<li>What assignments does the user have, and when are they due?</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is then synthesized into both a to-do list and a planner. This is because our design research showed that people felt that the pencil and paper equivalent of such features were convenient, but too much of a hassle to maintain.</p>
<p>The second way we make studying easier through automation is by blocking distracting material while the user is studying. Upon first opening the application, the user is asked to supply a list of websites that they find distracting. Then, whenever the user wants to study, they’ll press a button and every website on the list will be automatically blocked from their phone and computer until they terminate the study session, eliminating some distractions.</p>
<p>Another important feature of this design is a companion device in the form of a featureless white cube. When the user is productive this cube will glow green, if they spend too much time on unproductive websites not yet on the ban list, the cube will turn red and make a noise to remind them to get back on track.</p>
<p>Other features that this design supports include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing suggestions to the user regarding optimal study conditions based on their personal data</li>
<li>Recommending a healthy schedule of breaks so the user doesn’t overwork or burn out</li>
<li>Recommending new websites for the ban list if they appear to be distracting the user</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards</h3>
<p>Ultimately the design we chose to move forward with was Design 3. This design was chosen primarily through process of elimination. Design 1, we decided, was not the right choice because it demanded a lot of the user’s time and attention and our research tells us that that does not appeal to users at all. Design 2’s collaboration aspect, while appealing on the surface, consumed too much of the project’s identity, leaving it lacking in many of the features that we felt were important.</p>
<p>Although Design 3 was our final choice, it did not come out of this process unaltered. Most notably, we changed the companion cube into a bracelet in order to increase its portability. Additionally, instead of making a noise when the user is distracted, it vibrates instead so as to not disturb others in public workspaces such as libraries.</p>

<ng-template #designresearch_tidy>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Tidy's primary objective  is to optimize and simplify household management among shared living spaces such as dorms, apartments, and houses. In many of these living situations, the lack of an authority figure and/or individual accountability often leads to disorganized shared spaces, miscommunication, and tension among roommates or housemates. A household management platform such as Tidy would not only increase the livability of a household, but also alleviate potential disputes and help to maintain relationships. Aspects of shared living that Tidy addresses include chore delegation, finance management, scheduling, and communication.</p>
<p>Our solution to these household issues takes the form of a smartphone application, which leverages the feasibility and universal adoption of smartphones. Because household members are not home for a significant portion of the day, we needed our design to be both portable and convenient to access at all times. This property allows us to maximize the utility of features such as messaging and expense management. While other proposed designs such as a smartboard or smartwatch have their advantages, we believe that an all-in-one smartphone application for household management will ultimately allow for the greatest balance of both convenience and performance.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-approach">Design Research Approach</h3>
<p>Although all Tidy members have experienced shared living in our college career, our knowledge regarding this broad topic was still extremely limited. As a result, the primary goal for our design research was to gather a comprehensive collection of data and observations across a wide variety of living situations, including dorms, shared apartments, and even families. We further diversified our research by considering a range of roommate and housemate relationships, from best friends to former strangers.  Our research focused on these aspects of shared living: type of living situation, household chores, roommate relationships, conflict resolution, technology aids, and roommate relationships.</p>
<p>We chose to conduct semi-structured interviews as our primary design research method. The main advantage of interviews was the level of depth and detail it allowed for, especially in regards to specific household practices and circumstances. Although we initially considered contextual inquiries or focus groups, we decided that most of the relevant insight they would offer in regards to our problem space could also be obtained in an interview setting. To ensure that participants would be comfortable sharing about sensitive topics such as household conflict and roommate tension, we planned most of our interviews in a one-on-one setting. This gave participants the ability to confidentially discuss issues regarding other roommates, with the guarantee that their responses would not be shared or used outside of our design research process. To minimize the effect of personal bias on our research analysis, we scheduled separate interviews for multiple members of the same household to ensure well-rounded responses.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results">Design Research Results</h3>
<p>Our design research revealed a number of common patterns, most of which stemmed from a lack of household organization. Key insights and themes included chores being divided agreeably but not equally, disagreements on household standards, and a lack of proper organizational tools. These insights helped to inform our design direction and were derived directly from the various perspectives we gathered during the interview process.</p>
<p><strong>Chores are divided agreeably, but not equally.</strong> In most of our interviews, we found that chore workload was not being fairly divided among housemates, but rather in a way that was most easily agreed upon. One interviewee noted that &quot;It is hard to force someone to do something. Sometimes you just end up doing their chores for them or saying 'lets do it together'&quot;. Often times, one or two individuals end up taking on more of the burden. Chore assignments are typically determined verbally and managed mentally, which can make it difficult to come to a fair agreement that can also be easily maintained between all of the roommates.</p>
<p><strong>Agreeing upon standards and guidelines for clean living.</strong> When roommates do not share a fundamental understanding of what it means for the house to be clean deciding who does what becomes very messy. Imagine a situation where Sandra believes cleaning the bathroom to involve wiping down the counters and sink, scrubbing the toilet and shower, and mopping the floors, but Jimmy thinks that it is just replacing the toilet paper and making sure the toilet is not clogged. These differences in opinion introduce a lot of complexity in deciding who does what. Maybe you have to avoid having Jimmy cleaning the bathroom because you know he will not do it well, or Sandra ends up having to do extra work when she is assigned dishes but then the bathroom is a mess when she goes to use it. During an interview an interviewee had noted &quot;People have different standards or definitions of what constitutes clean, so if the app could outline standards or guidelines that would be helpful.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Combinations of tools not meant for managing a household are lacking.</strong> Very commonly our interviewees were using a combination of facebook messenger and venmo as their primary means of managing their household. Both of these tools have the foundational abilities to facilitate communication and financial transactions between roommates respectively but lack organization for managing a household. One continuous communication stream makes it hard to remember how it was agreed who would do what, needing to scroll all the way back to when it was decided to remember who does what. Similarly manually dividing up costs and sending individual requests is cumbersome, letting shared expenses slip through the cracks because they are too small to care about. Adding extra structure as wrappers to these tools that supply the foundational abilities is something that all of our interviews saw as something useful.</p>
<h3 id="tasks">Tasks</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Establishing Household Standards/Guidelines</em></p>
<p><strong>People have differing opinions in regards to what &quot;clean&quot; entails - thus, it is important to have clear household standards and guidelines.</strong> Many of our participants did not have clearly defined roles in the household which led to sporadic completion of chores by random housemates. While this method may thrive in living situations where housemates are close friends, we found that it was often a primary source of housemate disagreement and conflict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Maintaining Accountability</em></p>
<p><strong>Lack of an authoritative figure leads to accountability issues.</strong> Multiple participants mentioned that house members who do not pull their weight ultimately force others to carry their burden and complete their responsibilities. This could lead to passive aggressive confrontations between roommates and can strain relationships within the living space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Assigning Chores Based on Preference</em></p>
<p><strong>Certain members of a household may prefer one chore over another.</strong> In our research, we discovered that there were typically imbalances in household chore workloads. While this problem can be partially explained by a lack of accountability, we were interested in finding additional explanations to account for this imbalance. If members of a household are better suited to doing a specific chore over another, they could be better motivated to complete their assigned responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tracking Shared Expenses</em></p>
<p><strong>Tracking shared household expenses in a clear and transparent manner.</strong> We discovered through our interviews that money was a primary focus across our participant pool. All households had some form of shared expenses, such as groceries, cleaning supplies, or rent/utilities. Applications such as Venmo and Google Sheets were commonly utilized by our participants to manage shared finances, which motivated us to incorporate a feature that allowed for both tracking and paying for shared expenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Schedule Considerations</em></p>
<p><strong>Considering individual schedules in regards to chore distribution and overall household management.</strong> Because a majority of our participants were young working adults and students, their schedules were typically busy. Considering the daily schedules of users in order to fairly distribute the household workload was thus an important consideration. Participants also appreciated when their roommates let them know beforehand when guests would be over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Maintaining Positive Housemate Relationships</em></p>
<p><strong>Minimizing housemate conflict and strained relationships stemming from poor household management.</strong> Some of our participants had issues with their roommates that resulted from a lack of accountability and poor management of the living space. There were often passive aggressive interactions between roommates and some had difficulty with confrontation which progressed these interactions further.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design-sketches">Design Sketches</h3>
<p>The following illustrations depict three design directions that were considered during our ideation phase. The first design represents a mobile app concept, followed by a reimagined home &quot;smartboard&quot;, and a robotic companion that monitors chore completion status.</p>
<h4 id="mobile-app">Mobile App</h4>
<p>Our smartphone application design serves as a hub for a variety of household-related functions. This app allows users to check the completion status of certain chores, as well as the housemate responsible for completing the chore. Communication is another primary focus of this design - as a result, the app includes a messaging feature that allows roommates to send quick reminders or updates to one another. Finally, the app serves as an analytics and monitoring tool for shared household expenses. Shared transactions would be transparent to all household members, and notifications would alert members of their current dues or charges.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/app.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Figure 1. Mobile App design - sketch for household management tool.</p>
<h4 id="smartboard">Smartboard</h4>
<p>This design reimagines the common whiteboarding experience that many households still use to manage their homes. The smartboard aims to preserve the traditional writing experience while also allowing users to swap between multiple interfaces. One of the primary features of this design is that users would be able to leave anonymous comments on the board, serving as a non-aggressive way to remind roommates to do something. Moreover, because this would be a digital experience, users wouldn't have to worry about their comments being accidentally erased as the smartboard can autosave important information. Similar to the mobile app, the smartboard also comes equipped with additional features and interfaces such as scheduling, finances, and chore delegation.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/smartboard.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Figure 2. Smartboard sketch showcasing multiple interfaces and ability to write comments.</p>
<h4 id="mr-clean">Mr. Clean</h4>
<p>Our final design concept was rather outlandish and bold, but it addresses an aspect of shared living that often generates conflict. Introducing Mr. Clean, your new robotic roommate. Mr. Clean serves as a 3rd-party household mediator, primarily functioning to preserve the peace by alleviating the pressure of roommate confrontation. Mr. Clean routinely patrols the house and scans high priority rooms such as the bathroom, kitchen, and living room. If Mr. Clean detects a messy environment, he will actively seek the roommate responsible for maintaining that specific room and remind them to do their chores. Mr. Clean will also remind members of household cleaning standards if they consistently underperform. This design seeks to eliminate passive aggressive confrontation between roommates by leveraging an unbiased, fact-based system.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Figure 3. Mr. Clean the 3rd party household mediator.</p>
<h3 id="selected-design">Selected Design</h3>
<p>Moving forward we chose to expand on the app design for managing households. The app would mainly hold two functions of allowing each member of the household to view the chores that they have to complete and view the share of the expenses that they owe towards managing the household. In addition, the app would have other subfunctions to help in maintaining the chore structure and financials. We chose to pursue this design over the smart board and the robot helper/mediator. One reason was because we knew from the interviews that most were expecting an app to be developed to help them manage the house. In addition, we knew most users would not want to invest too much money into managing their household and the robot or smart board would be seen as a much greater investment than an app.</p>
<h3 id="storyboards">Storyboards</h3>
<h4 id="chore-accountability">Chore Accountability</h4>
<p>In this storyboard, we can see the user using the app to maintain accountability with completing chores. First, we see that the dishes have not been completed yet. Then, we see the person who was assigned the chore get a notification reminding them to complete the chore. Having seen the alert the user goes and completes the chore. Then after the chore is completed, they take a picture to verify that it was completed.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/storyboard1.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="shared-expense-tracking">Shared Expense Tracking</h4>
<p>In this storyboard we outline how the app would be used to help maintain financial accountability in the household. First, one of the users in the household notices that some shared items in the kitchen have been used up. So, the user heads to the store and purchases the shared items. After purchasing the items, the user inputs what he bought and the other roommates are notified of the new expense.</p>

<!--
TODO: It would be nice to have a place to put their tagline
AN EASY WAY TO TRACK AND SCAPE THE VAPE
--> 
<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview</h3>
<p>Electronic cigarettes and vaporizers have become popularized among teenagers, youths, and people who replaced traditional smoking with e-cigarettes. In fact, they were marketed as an easy way to quit traditional cigarettes, however, they are not an effective tool to quit nicotine completely, and they became a new way of addiction to nicotine with higher demand. Also, vaping has caused an inessential significant expense for the user as well.</p>
<p>We offer a beneficial solution called VapeWeight consisting of a smartphone application and a physical component. The physical component has the capability of both charging the vape device through a USB outlet and weighing the vape’s cartridge by a very sensitive scale sensor designated to keep track of the user’s daily nicotine intake. Every user can see their progress through the data collected on the VapeWeight application as well as joining the community forum on the app helping each other become vape free.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants</h3>
<p>The main focus of this project was to provide those who regularly vape a way to track the amount of nicotine vaped over time. Due to the increasing popularity of vaping in young adults, we focused our research participants among college students and young adults - both those who have used e-cigarettes exclusively as well as those who have switched from cigarettes to vaping as a means of quitting tobacco products. Other stakeholders we consider are high school-aged students. Although buying cigarettes and e-cigarettes are now limited to those 21 and over, research still shows vaping to be on the rise among this age group. Therefore, we conducted three different methods of interviews, diary studies, and surveys in order to better understand their needs and desire to quit vaping.</p>
<p>We decided on semi-structured interviews to allow us to observe their behaviors while asking them detailed questions. On the other hand, diary studies of our participants gave us insight into their psychological, physical, and social factors at their peak times. A survey was also an effective way to collect useful data on a larger scale, such as what participants’ current mental state is on quitting, how they feel about tracking their vaping usage, and what kinds of designs they prefer to use for quitting.</p>
<p>We conducted interviews and diary studies from a college student at the University of Washington who is also in the Greek community as vape usage in that community are high, an individual in the Seattle area between 25 - 40 years of age who replaced traditional cigarettes with e-cigarettes, and two different smoke shop owners. All other participants filled out the survey, and they were primarily college and high school students.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research Results and Themes</h3>
<p>According to the results of interviews, surveys, and diary studies that we conducted from all participants, we acquired a variety of information and key themes as follow:</p>
<h4 id="social-motivation">Social Motivation</h4>
<p>Those in a younger crowd are easily influenced by what their friends are doing, and all of our participants have indicated that they began and continue to vape due to social pressures, usually, their close friends are all regular vapers as well. When asked what might motivate participants to quit, some indicated that having others quit with them could help.</p>
<h4 id="use-of-e-cigarettes-as-a-tool-to-quit-tobacco">Use of E-cigarettes as a Tool to Quit Tobacco</h4>
<p>Our participants over 25 years old were all previous smokers and initially began vaping because they 1) wanted to quit tobacco completely, or 2) wanted to switch without the intent of quitting because they thought it was a “healthier” alternative.</p>
<h4 id="no-current-effective-tool">No Current Effective Tool</h4>
<p>From our research, there is nothing currently on the market explicitly for the purposes of quitting/monitoring the use of e-cigarettes without manual tracking. Traditional methods, such as patches and gum, are effective for the physical aspect but do not account for the psychological and social aspects which have become so synonymous with vaping. There is a mobile app that describes itself as being “the only app specifically for quitting vaping/juuling”. However, the user is required to track with another friend who vapes, and both individuals must monitor each others progress. The app also does not account for the difficulties of manual tracking. Furthermore, this app is useless if individuals want to quit without friends.</p>
<h4 id="college-aged-students-plan-to-quit-before-graduating">College-Aged Students Plan to Quit Before Graduating</h4>
<p>Our participants who began vaping when they were 18-21 years-old have all indicated that they hope to quit by the time they are 22. This is generally the age when students graduate from college. It is a fair assumption that these individuals might only consider vaping to be a “college habit” and do not believe this addiction could carry on beyond that.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>Based on our key findings and the main themes that we concluded from our studies, we decided to choose the following six tasks as the most important factors to consider in designing our solution.</p>
<p><b>Curbing cravings</b> of nicotine is very hard for a person who tries to either quit or eliminate his intake. This person might have strong cravings but do not want to talk about it due to the stigma around addiction. Having access to tips from people who were in their same positions and a community to talk about craving symptoms might help him to have the motivation to continue in his journey to quitting.</p>
<p><b>Learning about research on health risks of vaping</b> can also be helpful to motivate vape users to think more about their physical and mental health as well as helping those who are trying to quit to keep up with their good works throughout this challenging journey.</p>
<p><b>Connecting with friends and family to keep yourself accountable</b> is another way of motivating people to keep doing their hard work because sharing their vape usage keeps them accountable to themselves as well as others. They suspect that the one person who decreases her usage the most would get “bragging rights”. This would deliver a psychological reward and help to continue decreasing use.</p>
<p><b>Reducing vape usage / Gaining insights from tracked data</b> is a better approach for people who do not want to quit at once. If they keep track of their use, they would know how much they have vaped during a certain time, and they would be able to decrease it gradually.</p>
<p><b>Automatic tracking of how much nicotine/e-cigarette pods were vaped each day</b> is very needed for a person who wants to quit since manual tracking of e-cig liquid or the number of puffs taken during the day is almost impossible. Thus, the automatic taking of nicotine intake is an important and necessary task to consider.</p>
<p><b>Keeping track of money spent on buying E-liquids</b> is an important task to think about since vaping has caused a significant financial expense for the user in daily life. It can also become a motivation to quit for those who care about their spendings.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches</h3>
<h4 id="design-1-mobile-app-scaling-sensor">Design 1: Mobile App &amp; Scaling Sensor</h4>
<p>This design incorporates a physical component as well as a mobile application. The physical component is meant to be a simple, user-friendly, frustration-free device for gathering data. The main feature of the component is a drop-in area located on the top of the component weighs the vape cartridge. There is an indicator light to communicate to the user if the scale is functioning correctly or not. An additional feature on the component is a USB outlet for convenient charging of the vape battery. We chose to incorporate a battery charger to help the user remember to weigh their cartridge while they charge their battery. The other component of this design is the mobile application that gains insights from the data gathered from the physical component via Bluetooth. The app contains trends and data of user’s vape usage, user’s profile, and a community forum the features we considered to be most important to the user: tracking vape usage, tracking spending, finding an online community of other users trying to quit, and learning about important health topics related to vape research.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/physical_component_sketch.jpeg" width="100%" style="max-width: 500px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/mobile_app_sketch.jpeg" width="100%" style="max-width: 500px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="design-2-smart-portable-device">Design 2: Smart Portable Device</h4>
<p>The second design is a sensor that operates with batteries and is attached to the vape button, so it will account for each time the user hits their device. When the user first gets the product they will have options on an app in their phone with equivalencies for cigarettes. Corresponding to each option, information about health risks is received. For instance, if the user vapes very little they will be given information about short term effects like anxiety, where someone who smokes about a pack per day will be given health risks about the long term including cancer. Based on the user’s choice, the device will alert how close they are to their daily limit with different lights. When they are not close to their daily limit the light will be green, then go to yellow, and red when they are at their limit. This can help the user pace themselves out as they go so they don’t have to wait to see where they are at.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/smart_portable_sketch.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 400px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="design-3-smart-watch-app-e-cigarette">Design 3: Smart Watch App &amp; E-Cigarette</h4>
<p>The third design includes a rechargeable e-cig and a smartwatch. The e-cigarette has a similar shape to many popular vapes now but has a screen on the handle that designates the percentage of the pod vaped and/or how many puffs have been taken that day out of the desired puffs they have indicated. In fact, the e-cigarette itself has a sensor built inside that tracks the usage. The user has the option to buy pods that have different amounts of nicotine. The sensor in the e-cigarette will be able to distinguish the nicotine amount apart by barcodes on the pods. The smartwatch app is connected to the e-cigarette through Bluetooth and shows the data on the e-cigarette screen as well. Users are able to set a limit of how much they want to vape that day, either through pod percentage or amount of puffs. Once they have reached their desired limit, the e-cigarette will not allow them to vape until the next day.</p>

<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/smart_watch_sketch.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards</h4>
<p>We decided to continue with our first design, the “Mobile App &amp; Scaling Sensor”. We believe it would be the most convenient option for the user since there is no need to buy a new device, and it works with any kinds of vape devices/cartridges. For our design, we are focusing on the tasks of automatic tracking and connecting with friends and family. We decided to focus on these tasks, firstly, because we found no products on the market with the automatic tracking feature. From our research, many participants cited the challenge of manually tracking their vape usage due to the subconscious and habitual nature of vaping. Secondly, we want to leverage the social aspect of vaping, a recurring topic in most of our interviews with college-aged users. Because accountability is one of the most important aspects of undertaking the challenge of quitting tobacco products.</p>
