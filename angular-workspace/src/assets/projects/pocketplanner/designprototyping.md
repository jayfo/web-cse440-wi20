*Journal anywhere, any way you want*

by Lucy Jiang, Natasya Juliette, and Chia-Lin Liu

## Problem and Solution Overview
According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, “1 in 5 U.S. adults experience mental illness.” While bullet journaling is an existing method for people to organize their lives and corporate mindfulness into their lives, it is **inconvenient**, **time-consuming**, and **intimidating**. 

Pocket Planner transforms bullet journaling into a fully interactive digital and physical experience with a smart journal and an app, integrating automated tracking, data visualization, and various methods for data entry to personalize bullet journaling and make it more **efficient**, **empowering**, and **accessible** to all. Our smart journal design focuses on maintaining the tactile experience of writing down your tasks, journal entries, and plans, while our mobile app focuses on improving accessibility and efficiency. Though our initial project pitch was focused on making the artistic portion of bullet journaling less intimidating, throughout the quarter, we have found that making bullet journaling more accessible and efficient is just as important to both reducing the barrier to entry and increasing the rate of retention.

## Initial Paper Prototype

Our initial paper prototype included apps for four different devices: smart watches, smart phones, desktops / laptops, and smart journals. All apps supported checking calendars, jotting down to-do tasks, writing diaries, and marking habit trackers. These functionalities are all synced across the different platforms to make journaling more efficient and flexible.

## Testing Process
### Heuristic Evaluation
The evaluation was conducted in class by a student taking CSE 440. We first gave a brief introduction of our product to the participant and then the participant went through Nielsen’s 10 heuristics for all four platforms. The first issue that we uncovered was a lack of consistency among all four platforms in terms of functionality and design layout. The second was a lack of user control and freedom. This concern came from confusion about how to navigate between dates and weeks in the monthly and weekly spread and how to edit and delete events in the monthly spreads across the devices.

### Usability Tests
We followed the protocol presented below for our usability tests:
**Introduction / Warm-Up:** We introduced ourselves, explained the goals of a usability test, and discussed how it would work.
**Transition:** We explained the purpose of our project’s design and what our participant’s role was.
**Test:** We asked the participant to complete two tasks:
Access their organization tools everywhere across multiple devices
Take time to be mindful and to write down tasks and thoughts
**Wrap-Up:** We asked the participant for feedback, both positive and constructive, regarding the usability of the design, consistency across different platforms, and the clarity of the overall system. 

#### Participant 1
For our first usability test, our participant was Jaden (pseudonym), a senior in Computer Science who is also taking CSE 440 this quarter. We chose to ask Jaden as his project is similar to ours (Remi-nice) and focuses on increasing mindfulness without adding too many additional tasks; however, there are a couple of key differences. We wanted to understand what insights he could bring to our project since he has also thought about similar functionalities. We conducted the usability test in the CSE Atrium at 9:30 PM. Our test protocol consisted of Chia-Lin prompting Jaden to perform each task on each platform. Chia-Lin was the facilitator and Lucy and Natasya were the observers and computers. A revision for our process is to make sure that our usability testers use all four platforms interchangeably for finishing a task, so that they can test how someone would react to the idea that some limitations on some devices (such as the smart watch) have different interactions on other devices.

#### Participant 2
After making revisions to our paper prototype based on the first usability test, we conducted our second usability test during quiz session with Alice (pseudonym), a senior in Computer Science who is also taking CSE 440 this quarter. We chose to ask Alice because she is in our target audience, she has also learned about HCI through the class, and she has a bit of experience with bullet journaling. We conducted the usability test in Room 295 of Mary Gates Hall at 1:30 PM as part of our section activities. Chia-Lin was the facilitator and computer and Natasya was the facilitator and observer. One key difference between this and the previous usability test is that we allowed the participant to get familiar with the prototype in the beginning and laid out all four platforms instead of presenting them one at a time. This change helped the participant see the product as a whole instead of thinking of it as four different designs. Another revision we made for our process was to give the participant a more holistic scenario in which they would perform the tasks, instead of asking them to complete the tasks as they would cater to each individual product. This helped us learn how they would navigate through all four devices seamlessly.

#### Participant 3
For our third usability test, our participant was Harry (pseudonym), a 28-year-old software engineer at Google. We chose to ask Harry as he fits as our target audience; he is active and has a busy schedule throughout the week. We also wanted to understand what insights and new perspectives that people other than students could bring to our project. We conducted the usability test at a friend’s house in Shoreline at 9 PM. We chose this location because it was more convenient for him. Our test protocol consisted of Natasya prompting Harry to perform each task on each platform. She was also the observer and computer. The key difference between this and previous usability tests was that we gave the participant broader tasks and more concrete scenarios for each task. This change helped the participant picture the situation and act more naturally, like they would in a real-life situation. Especially as the participant was not a student in CSE 440, this usability test also helped to expose a couple of other confusing portions of our design.

## Testing Results and Prototype Refinement

### Inconsistency across all platforms and devices
One major issue that we faced was ensuring consistency across all platforms. Each group member created the paper prototype for each different platform. We ended up with fairly different versions of the app both in the interface design and functionality. Though each platform has its own methods of specialized interaction, the interface design and basic functionalities should still be consistent because agreeing upon a consistent user interface design and set of functionalities helps people keep a clear mental model.

![Usability Inconsistency](usability_inconsistency.png)
*Revisions included making all the icons consistent across devices and removing the mood tracking function from some devices.*

### Lack of user control and freedom to add and remove things and jump between dates
Another issue that came up was the incapability to add and remove things from the apps. This problem occurred across all platforms. In the smart journal, we initially did not account for erasing writing, and we did not incorporate the idea of removing habit trackers across all of the platforms. Our usability tests revealed that people can make mistakes, and designs require ways to either prevent errors or warn people that their actions are invalid. We have worked on supporting functionalities to add, edit, and remove events or tasks on all of our platforms.

Additionally, the only way to view different entries or habit trackers was to swipe left and right or pressing the left and right arrows to manually and incrementally go through time. There was no fast way to see entries or spreads from previous months or years. We have added a date jumping functionality, which follows existing calendar design patterns to make it easier for people to access different dates across days, weeks, months, or years.

![Usability User Control](usability_user_control.png)
*Revisions included adding an edit and delete functionality and a date jumper functionality.*

### Lack of clarity with graph visualizations
Our last primary revision was for the graph visualizations of the habit trackers. Our design previously had no real values and units and lacked meaning and significance. Based on feedback from our usability testing, we have added some units and numerical data to give a more detailed and clear tracking record, and we also clarified what the goal line represented. 

![Usability Clarity](usability_clarity.png)
*Revisions included adding annotations and labels for habit trackers.*

### Changes Between the Paper Prototypes and the Digital Mockups
The biggest change we made in our digital mockup was to abandon the smart watch and desktop app designs. We encountered several issues with internal consistency across the different platforms. Initially, we designed the apps across multiple platforms to improve the accessibility and convenience of bullet journaling. However, these inconsistencies caused our participants to be confused when they could use some functionalities on the mobile app but not on the smart watch, or vice versa. At first, we revised our designs on all of the platforms to make them consistent, but we later found out that cutting out unnecessary apps was a more effective and time-efficient way to reduce a participant’s confusion. As a result, we re-analyzed the necessity of each app and made two main decisions: to transform the easy accessibility of the smart watch app into a widget of the mobile app, and to remove the desktop design as its primary functionality of providing a larger display for clearer graphs was possible through the smart journal.

Based on our findings, the mobile app in the digital mockup has an extra widget for improved accessibility. The widget provides a quick view of today’s events and tasks, and allows someone to quickly check and input information into their to-do lists, diary entries, or habit trackers. This eliminates the need to open and load the mobile app just to check events or habit trackers, making the interaction less inconvenient. As for the smart journal, it still allows people to write things down and have a tactile experience with bullet journaling, while also providing a larger viewing area. The two platforms that we created for our digital mockups were the mobile app, which focuses on convenience, efficiency, and accessibility, and the smart journal, which provides people with the tactile experience that they know and love.
