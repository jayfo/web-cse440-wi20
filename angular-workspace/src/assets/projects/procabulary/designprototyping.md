### 1. Problem and Solution Overview
From our design research, we felt that our participants wanted to be able to easily access the speech analysis and improvements section, as well as track their progress throughout their experience. The problem of new people in their fields struggling with learning and mastering sophisticated jargon remained the focus as we created our initial design. As mentioned earlier, we chose to use a watch and smartphone app pair for our solution, as we felt like it best met the tasks obtained from our design research. Initially, we tried to focus our solution on easy access to speech analysis and improvements, since we felt like that is what our design research pointed us to. This is reflected in the paper prototype below and the tasks we supported with the prototype.

### 2. Initial Paper Prototype
The initial paper prototype overview can be seen below:

<p style="text-align: center"><b>initial prototype overview</b></p>

There are two components of ProCabulary's initial design. There is a phone application that is paired with a smart watch.

The first task that was outlined in the paper prototype was to learn the technical knowledge bank from conversations. This includes the wearable pairing process and wearable recording steps, which can be seen here:
 
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task1_1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 250px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task1_2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 250px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task1_3.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 250px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task1_4.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 250px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task1_5.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 250px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task1_6.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 250px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
</p>

The other aspects of this task have to do with learning the knowledge, which can be done by looking at the recordings summary page, which has a record of conversations and a detailed description of each recording with playback functionality:

<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task1_7.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 250px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task1_8.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 250px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
</p>
 
The keywords page has a list of words taken from the recordings that are arranged by topic and sorted by frequency, so each person can easily see the words they want to learn:
 
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task1_9.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 250px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
</p>
 
The second task that was outlined in the paper prototype was to raise the level of professionalism in one’s own speech. This can be accomplished via the improvements page, as it shows words and phrases you are currently doing well in, keywords you need to improve on, and similar words that relate to the topic. Clicking on one of the bars brings up the detailed view of the given word:

<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task2_1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 250px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task2_2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 250px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task2_3.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 250px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
</p>

### 3. Testing Process

Our testing process includes 3 **heuristic evaluations** with another group from class as well as 2 students outside CSE department; 2 **design critiques** with TAs and other 2 groups during sections, and 3 **usability tests** of our paper prototypes with our target participants who have particular requirements to master their sophisticated and specialized jargons and information in their professional realms.

#### Heuristic Evaluation
* Evaluation 1: Evaluated by Sarah, conducted by Francis and Zhennan
* Evaluation 2: Evaluated by Jane, conducted by Francis, Karron and Zhennan
* Evaluation 3: Evaluated by Group x from CSE 440, conducted by Francis, Arjun and Zhennan

In our initial heuristic evaluation, we began with laying out all of our paper prototypes on the table and giving our participants an exploratory walkthrough of our prototypes so that they can be familiarized with our system. Subsequently, we asked our participants to attempt to finish 2 of our primary tasks. Then we went over the heuristic evaluation one by one and discussed any further questions. However, with our first participant, we found out that our participant had a strong inclination to follow the procedures we just showed to finish the task instead of understanding what she was asked to do and reacted based on what was presented on the paper prototype. Therefore, in the following heuristic evaluations, we instead introduced our study, our system as well as tasks to be carried out to our participants patiently and gave a brief walkthrough of our system with an unrelated task before testing our prototypes. Afterward, the team went through each of the problems we spotted during heuristic evaluation and discussed potential reasons and corresponding solutions.

#### Design Critiques
After the initial in-class evaluation and testing, we received feedback from our TAs, Jesse and Richard, regarding our goal setup process. “How do we evaluate goals and progress during the first few weeks of use; where do your sources of data come from in the first few weeks for evaluation” etc. Those questions were instructive and enlightening for us, as it pushed us to think thoroughly and profoundly in terms of the pivotal goal-setting process and its potential influence on users’ following actions. It was helpful because we were able to brainstorm solutions and receive feedback immediately.

#### Usability Testings
* Test1: Biology major undergraduate student who works as a Lab Assistant in a Biology Lab.
* Test2: A first-year master’s student from UW’s information school who is trying to pursue a career in technical consulting.
* Test3: a UW HCDE undergraduate student during CSE 440 usability testing section.

All of our 3 usability testings went smoothly well and we received a lot of insightful responses and meaningful suggestions. Our usability testing consisted of 3 important stages. The first stage was background questions for us to gain general ideas regarding our participants’ current circumstances (e.g. Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), etc. In the meantime, we also offered our participants a brief overview of our study for them to build a basic understanding of our prototype. The initial stage created an opportunity for us to build rapport with our participants. The second stage was our main usability testing, which we divided into 2 parts based on 2 primary tasks we decided to support. The final stage was debriefings and asking and answering questions regarding our participants’ experience with the prototypes, confusions and thoughts. Initially, we had multiple team members acting as the notetakers. However, as we repeated the process, we found out that this created too much extra work to compile and organize and locate our testing documents later on. Therefore, we then let one team member be the notetaker for the rest of the usability testing to document changes more systematically. Similarly, as the testing progressed, each of us was getting familiarized with the roles we’ve selected and made the testing process more efficient.

### 4. Testing Results and Prototype Refinement

<p style="text-align: center"><b>prototype refinements overview</b></p>
 
#### Home screen revision 
Although the participants appreciated the motivation design on the landing page, 2 of them mentioned that since the main goal of using this app is to collect information from conversations and to improve their speech, they would like to see more content related to the past conversations, rather than the progress chart and feeds. Based on their feedback, we decided to include interactive elements that are more irrelevant to their improvement on the home page. In the revisioned home screen, users can check out their most recent recordings and assessment of their recent progress.

<p style="text-align: center"><b>main page - paper prototype changes</b></p>

#### Timeline revision 
In the initial paper prototype, we include timeline as a tool to help the participant track their improvement process. However, the initial timeline design is confusing, including only the status of “accomplished” and “not accomplished” tasks. Our participants were unclear about what a “task” is, and how can those milestones on the timeline give them a more tangible idea of their accomplishment. One of our participants suggested that it would be more helpful if statistical reports of each task were provided. We decided to tackle this issue by establishing a more solid measurement of the user’s progress toward their goal. After testing the revised version with P3, we found out that, from a beginner’s point of view, the tasks in the timeline might be less intimidating if the tasks can be broken down into several small tasks.

<p style="text-align: center"><b>timeline - paper prototype changes</b></p>

#### Goals setting revision 

Based on the feedback of our participants, the goal-setting feature in the initial paper prototype is vague. It only allows them to choose between beginner, intermediate and advanced, and once the users set their goals, the system would generate a timeline accordingly. This leads to several issues. For example, if P2 wants to improve her speech, then it wouldn’t be as helpful if the system assigns her tasks of memorizing vocabulary. We decided that the goal-setting should be more granular so that some users can choose to focus mostly on vocabulary learning, while others can primarily focus on speech improvement. To further define the goals, we decided to extract information from the user by using a survey. Users can not only select the fields that they want to develop verbal expertise but also which task they want to perform. Another problem is that the users’ self-perceived competencies in their areas might be different from the reality, so we decided to introduce the concept of ‘trial week’ during setup, where a baseline of skill level is established during the first week of use.

#### Practice mode revision 

We didn’t have robust practice functionality in our initial design, and two participants in our usability tests expressed a desire to be able to do more of that, which highlighted it as an important issue for us to solve. We tackled the problems from both perspectives, adding quizzes in the keyword section and adding the mock conversation feature in the improvement section. Fixing this problem is important since it adds functionality people seek to use. The practice mode allows people to review the things they see as important to them and lets them try out their newfound knowledge in a safe space with the mock conversation tool.

### 5. Final Paper Prototype 

#### Task 1: Record speech and review compiled words, phrases and summaries

The participant who downloaded the app on their phone as well as on their smartwatch needs to go through a setup process to pair the watch and the phone for secure audio data transfer. Then the participant needs to register his/her voice to let the system recognize the master during recording. After registering the voice to the system, the client will be prompted to set the goals he/she wants to reach in the future. After watching a short tutorial, the system and the wearable are ready to work. When we walk through a scenario in which the client has already finished recording on his/her watch, the client is able to tap the the watch again and open the app on the phone to check the detailed information parsed and extracted by the system.

#### Task 2: Improve vocabulary and speech through practice mode

When the participant opens the app for the first time, he/she needs to set up his/her profile, providing information about which field he/she wants to improve their proficiency in, his/her current fluency in that field, and what goal he/she wishes to achieve. To do so, the participant should click the Status and Goal. After specifying his/her fields, the participant can see the survey that contains two sections. The participant can choose either of the sections or both of them according to his/her needs. The survey serves as an initial measurement of the participant's verbal competencies based on his/her perception. However, because participants' perceptions of their competencies might vary from reality, the system will assess their skill level and establish it as the baseline of their improvement journey. The participant can track his/her progress by clicking the timeline icon on the lower menu. They can also take the quiz and mock conversations to strengthen memorization and practice their speech. 

### 6. Digital Mockup
 
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/digital_overview.png" alt="initial prototype overview" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>digital mockup overview</b></p>

We made 3 significant changes in the process of transitioning from paper prototype to digital mockup. First and foremost, we consolidated practice modes in our digital mockup to include more obvious practice buttons, immersive conversations and incorporate results into the progress page, so that it is convenient for users to review and track their progress over time. The improvement page in our paper prototypes received a design overhaul in our digital mockup compared to our paper prototypes to be more informative as well as enlightening. Originally, we provided only binary analyzed results of highlighted keywords as well as corresponding audio clips. But in our digital mockup, we enriched the entire page by adding more relevant details, such as the matching keywords of a specific context and its explanations and usages, to better help our users memorize important information through contextualization. In the digital mockup, we include a universal search button in summary, keyword and improvement pages, instead of the hidden search bar, to make it more obvious, easy-to-reach and give them direct shortcuts to filter out and pinpoint the materials they specifically want.

#### Tasks Breakdown		
Our two primary tasks are: **1) Record speech and review compiled words, phrases and summaries** and **2) Raise the level of professionalism in one's own speech through practices**. Descriptions of each of these tasks are provided below, alongside the important digital mockup components. 

##### Task 1: Record speech and review compiled words, phrases and summaries
Users who downloaded the app on their phone as well as on their smartwatch need to go through several initial setup processes to activate the system. In particular, they need to pair their watch with their mobile devices for secure audio data transmission as well as setting up their short-term and long-term goal by answering a series of questions. The setup process is crucial, as it acts as the basis for the system to recognize its user, adjust itself based on user’s particular circumstances, and provide more accurate subsequent analysis and suggestions. Moreover, our design also allows users to take advantage of summaries and keywords functionalities inside the App to review important materials, words, phrases after professional conversations. For example, users can take a look at each summary block to remind himself/herself of the topic and key content of a certain conversation. Even, they can utilize the key audio clips attached to each summary for more context and information. In addition to the summary page, the keywords page can assist users to memorize the most useful and important words, phrases from professional conversations. If they still feel confused about particular words, they can open key audio clips and definitions to reactivate their memory. The primary aim of the design is to help users build concrete foundations in their professional industries. A walkthrough is shown below:

**Use of Watch.**
Users are able to fully control their data on their watches. For instance, if they find one conversation to be particularly essential, they can highlight them using flags and their priority in the system will rise. Similarly, if they find a conversation meaningless or pointless, they can directly delete the recording in the middle of the recording.

**Browse Summaries.**
Users can use the summary as a quick reminder to review the essential parts in a conversation without reaching to more details.

    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>summary page details</b></p>
  </div>
</div>
 
**Review Keywords.**
Users are able to sort keywords either by their frequencies that appeared in the professional conversations or topics they belong to for more precise and effective learning. 

<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  <div style="max-width: 250px; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block;" class="m-3">

    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>keyword page details</b></p>
  </div>
</div>
 
##### Task 2: Raise the level of professionalism in one's own speech through practices
Our second task focuses on long-term improvements of professionalism in one’s own speeches and is greatly supported by our practice mode as well as improvement feature. The practice mode in the keyword list enables users to strengthen their memory about those keywords by using quizzes. Additionally, the improvement features can help users contextualize their understanding towards certain keywords using contexts in the conversations; practice mode in the improvement page allows users to participate in an immersive, professional conversation with a virtual assistant on the topics they’ve selected. All the results will be combined and display directly on the progress page and main page so that users can easily keep track of their progress. The primary objective of the design is to inform users of their inadequacy in certain areas and help them improve accordingly. A walkthrough is shown below:

**Practice Mode in Keyword.**
Sometimes, accurately memorizing keywords and jargon and their definitions are key to academic success. Under this circumstance, users can tap the “Quiz” button at the bottom of the keyword page and opt to have quizzes to strengthen their memorization. So that once a keyword pops up from conversations, users can immediately recognize it and extend the conversations to be more in-depth and intriguing.

    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>quiz</b></p>
  </div>
</div>

**Practice Mode in conversations.**
It’s common for users who have difficulties speaking the professional language to be intimidated by engaging in professional conversations with others. In this case, they can practice by themselves using the practice mode in conversation. By clicking the “start mockup” button at the bottom of the improvement page and choosing which topics to cover, users can start a conversation with the AI chatbot. When the mockup conversation is finished, the analysis report of their mockup conversation can be found in the improvement page for the users to check out their performance in the practice.

    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>professional conversation practices</b></p>
  </div>
</div>

**Contextualize keywords using context from conversations.**
If users feel that they have difficulties to choose the most appropriate words in the correct contexts, they can browse the suggested uses keywords related to the contexts in the improvement page. 

<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  <div style="max-width: 250px; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block;" class="m-3">
