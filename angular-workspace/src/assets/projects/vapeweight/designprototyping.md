#### Overview


As mentioned in the last post, as the use of electronic cigarettes and vaporizers becomes more popular among teenagers, youths, and people who replaced traditional smoking with e-cigarettes, there is a need for consumers to easily track their consumption and provide insights for those who would like to quit or maintain their nicotine consumption.
Our design research showed that social motivation influences if and when individuals start and stop vaping, but there is currently no tool that helps those who use e-cigarettes or vaporizers quit. Based on this research and several design ideas, our final design is a smartphone application and a physical component. Which allows users to keep track of their nicotine intake, see their progress through the data collected in the VapeWeight application, and provides a community forum and messaging to allow users on the app to help each other become vape free.


#### Initial Paper Prototype


The following prototypes show the initial designs of the physical component that weighs the e-liquid, and the application that is connected to by Bluetooth. The application is working based on the two main tasks that we considered earlier.

##### Task 1: Auto-Tracking 
This prototype illustrates the first main task which shows how a person can access their Dashboard where the synced data is after they set up their account.

##### Task 2: Accountability and Support
This prototype illustrates the second main task which outlines the main features of the app pertaining to community, support, and personal accountability.

#### Testing Process


##### Usability Test 1
The first participant is a 19-year-old male student at the University of Washington in a fraternity who would like to quit vaping eventually but would like to monitor his usage first, making him a perfect participant in our test. The study was conducted in Odegaard library as it was a convenient location for our group and for himself to meet, and our prototype is meant to be used at any location. We had our participant work on two separate tasks: onboarding a device and tracking vape usage. Shariya gave the initial introduction and explanation of tasks to the participant, while Angela took notes, Molly moved the prototype pieces around, and Niloofar addressed concerns and answered questions from him.


##### Usability Test 2
The second participant is a 17-year-old female high school student. They want to quit vaping because they spend too much money on it, and plan to quit at the same time as friends. We conducted the study at the participant’s house. We chose to test the app from a high schooler’s perspective because they grew up with technology and can easily tell if the app is working smoothly. They are also the most likely age to quit as a group, so we wanted to ensure that they would use the social aspect of the app. We had her go through the app first onboarding a device, then we asked her to go to her feed, and go to the menu with groups. Shariya gave the overview to the participants while Molly and Niloofar took notes and Angela moved the prototype pieces. We all were talking and asking questions throughout. 


##### Usability Test 3
The third participant is a 22-year-old female college student who is a current vape user and is eager to quit. We met her in Mary Gates Hall and had the opportunity to go over the whole prototype. She made a perfect candidate to test our prototype due to her age and history with peer-influenced vaping habits. During this usability test, Shariya and Niloofar arranged the paper prototype, while Angela and Molly took notes of her feedback and asked her clarifying questions. 


##### Testing Refinement Overview
Throughout each test, we made small changes to how we conducted the usability tests. We initially conducted tests with classmates and asked basic questions about placement and aesthetics and used that information to refine the paper-prototype. With the refined prototype we conducted usability tests on people who were most likely to use the app. We asked tailored tasks to each person who falls in the group most likely to use that feature so we would have the most accurate situation. 


#### Testing Results and Prototype Refinement
Based on the feedback from our first usability test, we plan on expanding our onboarding process of the physical device to the app and updating our model of the vape usage data. We added a place to indicate the brand of cartridge used or manual input if our app does not have data on the user’s particular brand or cartridge type. This will allow our physical device to accurately track data. We also switched our vape usage graph to the percentage used as opposed to the percent left throughout the day, as well as including a note for the user’s peak hours.

According to the feedback from our second usability test, we decided to have the main titles in tiles so she can see all of her options from the social setting rather than having menus which are harder to see and find. Also, we planned to change the name from “Groups” to “Social” for listing the social option as well as changing the wording of some texts as necessary.

Finally, our last participant from the 3rd usability test stated that the first few pages of our design - which guide the user to set up their accounts and physical component - had too much text. She also recommended having a back button on each page rather than pressing the home page or tab the user needed each time. Therefore, we consolidated the amount of text in the setup process and added a back button at the top of each page.

#### Final Paper Prototype


Our final paper prototype gave us an opportunity to consider all of our feedback from testing and incorporate it into our design. We made some visual changes according to our usability tests, which suggested that users preferred to see the amount left within their cartridge versus the amount of cartridge vaped within the usage period (day/week/month). One of the most thorough changes made was to our Social pages. Initially, our language was confusing (“Groups” vs “Community”) and the social menu was hidden within the Groups page. We added a landing page for all social categories and updated the language to consistently be “Social”.


Aside from the changes made to the main features of the mobile application, we also incorporated the suggestions from our usability tests to improve our onboarding process. We minimized the text to only include what we considered necessary and added more personalization options to the profile setup page.

#### Digital Mockup


Our digital mockup was probably the most fun aspect of this whole project. It gave us a chance to focus more on the aesthetic of the application and perfect it to how we had imagined it, but couldn’t always draw on paper just right. We used Figma to create our mockup and learned a lot about the importance of consistency. We found that if our application had gotten much bigger, we would have needed a well-documented Style Guide to keep track of fonts, colors, and sizing. For the mockup, we focused on the two tasks of 1) automatic tracking, and 2) social accountability. For the social aspect, we highlighted the process of navigating to the Groups area, the Discussions, and how to create a new post. We also highlighted other features our application would include within the Social area, such as Friends, Messages, and Chat. For automatic tracking, we included the initial onboarding for a new user which walks them through the setup of their physical VapeWeight device and pairs it to the app using Bluetooth. After the pairing is complete, users are directed to an introduction of their Dashboard (essentially the home screen). The Dashboard contains the user’s most up-to-date information at a glance, including an overview of their vape usage and any new social notifications. From their Dashboard, users can click the “Track” button which navigates them to the automatic tracking section of the application. Users can then choose to view their data in List or Detail view, and can gain insights such as peak vaping hours, equivalent number of cigarettes smoked, and if they are above or below their average use.
