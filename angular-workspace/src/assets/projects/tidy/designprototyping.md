### Overview

Tidy's primary objective  is to simplify household management among shared living spaces such as dorms, apartments, and houses. In many of these living situations, the lack of individual accountability can lead to miscommunication, disorganization, and unwelcome roommate tension. A household management platform such as Tidy would not only increase the livability of a household, but also alleviate potential disputes and help maintain relationships. Aspects of shared living that Tidy focuses on include automatic chore delegation and chore accountability. While we did not fully explore these features in our final mockup, future iterations of Tidy could also include finance management and schedule features..

Our solution to these household issues takes the form of a smartphone application, which leverages the convenience and universal adoption of smartphones. Through our design research, we discovered that common issues with our interface stemmed from a lack of both internal and external consistency. Our research also led us to narrow Tidy's focus to chore management specifically, as designs that included various additional household management features proved to be too cluttered and confusing for users to navigate. As a result, our final digital mockup represents a balance between the themes of minimalism, accessibility, and functionality.

### Initial Paper Prototype

After deciding upon our smartphone application design, we began brainstorming ideas for our paper prototype. Our initial goal was lofty - to create a comprehensive household management application that offered all household-related functionalities, including chores, finances, scheduling, and messaging. The two tasks we chose to focus on were maintaining chore accountability and managing shared finances, so we concentrated on these aspects of in prototype.

Once the picture is taken, it is automatically sent to the participants roommates for confirmation. 

<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/webImage37.jpg" alt="initial prototype - chore marked as complete" width="100%" style="max-width: 200px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
</p>

Once a specified number of roommates have viewed the chore and confirmed that it is completed, the chore is marked as "complete" on the My Chore page.

### Testing Process

#### Heuristic Evaluation

A heuristic evaluation was held to identify any transparent issues in the design before any interactions with it take place. Because evaluators needed a general understanding of the issues to look out, our participants were limited to those familiar with the process (i.e. CSE 440 students). We began our tests by walking the participants through the general design flow and explained the basic functionalities supported by our design. The participants were then asked to evaluate the design based on a predetermined list of heuristics.

#### Usability Tests

We conducted our first usability test with a current senior studying Aeronautics and Aerospace Engineering from the University of Washington at Odegaard Undergraduate Library, as it was an accessible location for the participant. He currently lives with his family, but has experience living with roommates.

Our second usability test was conducted in section with a fellow CSE 440 student. This student is a junior at the University of Washington and has experience in developing both user interfaces and paper prototypes. Both the participant and testing location were preset by the course staff.

Our third usability test participant is a current senior at the University of Washington who currently lives with six housemates in an off-campus house. Because this participant’s living situation matches our target demographic, it allowed us to gather direct insight as to whether our design is suitable for our user group. The test was conducted in Mary Gates Hall due to its accessibility and convenience for our participant.

Each usability test began with a brief introduction to the design and goals for the test. Participants were encouraged to share what they were thinking aloud during the execution of the tasks we set for them and following the test, debriefed with test overseers about any lingering thoughts or confusion they had about the current prototype.

#### Testing Process Changes

For every iteration of our tests besides our initial heuristic evaluation, we produced a revised paper prototype based on results from the prior test. This allowed us to reduce the volume of similar insights we would gather from subsequent tests and enabled us to focus on a different set of tasks for the next test. In our first usability test, the person acting as the “computer” was not aware of all possible interactions with the paper prototype. To prevent confusion in later tests, we performed several practice runs with the latest revision of the prototype to ensure that the “computer” felt comfortable with all of the prototype’s functions. We also decided to rotate roles throughout the testing process in hopes of provoking new insights.

### Testing Results and Prototype Refinement

During our heuristic evaluations, we discovered design flaws resulting from a lack of outside perspective during the creation of our initial design. One flaw we discovered was a failure to match our design to the real world. For example, the "chores" icon in the navigation bar was initially represented by a coat hanger. Our testing revealed that no one instinctively associates this icon with chores. We fixed this general issue by representing more sections of the interface using plain text and revising our navigation icons. A second issue that the heuristic evaluations revealed was a lack of internal consistency. In the pictures below, you can see a dollar sign and a check mark both being used to "confirm" similar tasks, which confused our participants. As a result, maintaining consistency became a focus of the remainder of the design process.

<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/webImage38.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>

After our usability tests, we found that the scope of our project was too broad, which led our interface to be cluttered and unintuitive. Because we included various finance-related functionalities and basic messaging features on top of chore management, our participant's mental model of the app was heavily divided between different modes. We also realized that existing popular products such as Venmo and Facebook Messenger already offered these features, so we decided to shift Tidy's focus away from these areas.

Another issue we found related to the task of chore prioritization. While participants were typically able to successfully complete the task, most did not understand the significance of doing so. To address this problem, we emphasized the idea that chores were arranged based on priority and added a notification feature that sends push notifications to household members when their chore is "prioritized".

Another major problem we encountered was a failure to correctly set up our participant's mental model. Because the household creation and chore preference settings were back to back in the setup process, our participant was unable to distinguish between the purposes of the two tasks. Rather than setting his own personal preferences, our participant thought that he was setting household-wide preferences, making him the "household authority figure". This discrepancy between our design's perceived purpose and the intended purpose negatively influenced our participant's interaction with the design, even after the initial setup. To solve this problem, we clearly separated the two tasks by moving the chore preference selection to the user profile page, distinguishing it from the initial household setup process.

Another change we decided to make based on usability testing was the removal of the picture confirmation to mark a chore as completed. We received feedback that this feature felt like a burden on the usability of the design and would be completely unnecessary in a house with a basic foundation of trust. 

#### Themes in Testing Results

One of the most difficult considerations regarding the participants' attention and time was the balance between functionality and tedium. Every effort to provide additional functionality came with some kind of cost in terms of the participants' time or attention. We found this to be a fundamental challenge - how do we provide useful user feedback while maintaining an intuitive user experience when interacting with the design? When deciding how to approach this problem, we ended up focusing on allowing the user to interact with it on their own terms.

The most notable theme across our testing results was what we entitled muddied mental models. Across all iterations of our prototypes, we struggled to set up mental models for our participants that accurately reflected the design's intended purpose. In our early tests, this was demonstrated by an over-division of the mental model from the wide range tasks that our prototype attempted to support. This was addressed by iteratively moving towards an emphasis on chore management, with clear navigation to guide users toward this focus. In later usability tests, an oversight in the chore preference setup process misled participants from the actual intended purpose. We struggled with this problem throughout the entire design process and worked tirelessly to ensure that Tidy's manifest model offered a clear and intentional purpose for future users.

### Final Paper Prototype

We understood that our final paper prototype would function as a guideline for the digital mockup. So, during the development of this final iteration we worked to implement a minimalist aesthetic to give ourselves more freedom to develop visual ideas in the mockup. Despite our minimalist focus, we were intentional about maintaining basic design elements that were in our original designs to ensure that that they would be carried over to the final product.

</p>

The chores on the chore page rearrange to show the most "reminded" chore on top.  John receives a push notification reminding him to complete the chore.

#### Task 2: Chore Preference Consideration

<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/webImage44.jpg" alt="final prototype - tooltip prompt" width="100%" style="max-width: 200px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/webImage45.jpg" alt="final prototype - tapping on tooltip profile" width="100%" style="max-width: 200px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
</p>

After joining a household, all participants are prompted by a tooltip to rank their chores preferences on the profile page. 

<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/webImage46.jpg" alt="final prototype - profile chore preferences" width="100%" style="max-width: 200px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">

</p>

From the profile page, participants drag and drop chores to adjust their preferences. The participant is brought back to the main chore page, where chores are automatically delegated as members join. 

### Digital Mockup

As we transitioned from our paper prototype to the digital mockup, we decided to change an aspect of the household setup process. We felt like our current solution for how users were inputting what types of chores were required in their household was not optimized. Previously users would have to type out each individual chore and the instructions to go along with it. However, while we were in the process of making our mockups we thought it would be better to let users select from a set of common chores with an option to add more chores if necessary. We did not get to user test this idea, but we believe it helps maximize the efficiency.

#### Task 1 - Chore Preference Consideration

Kara is a new Tidy user and hopes that Tidy will help her and her roommates create a more organized system to distribute household duties. Upon opening Tidy for the first time, Kara decides to set up an account and create a household. After completing the initial setup, Kara can then set her personal chore preferences. From that point on, Tidy's algorithm will automatically assign chores to everyone in the household, taking into account chore preferences, completion rate, and assignment history.
