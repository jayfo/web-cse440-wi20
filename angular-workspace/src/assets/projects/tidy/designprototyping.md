Overview
--------

Tidy's primary objective  is to simplify household management among shared living spaces such as dorms, apartments, and houses. In many of these living situations, the lack of individual accountability can lead to miscommunication, disorganization, and unwelcome roommate tension. A household management platform such as Tidy would not only increase the livability of a household, but also alleviate potential disputes and help maintain relationships. Aspects of shared living that Tidy focuses on include automatic chore delegation and chore accountability. While we did not fully explore these features in our final mockup, future iterations of Tidy could also include finance management and schedule features..

Our solution to these household issues takes the form of a smartphone application, which leverages the convenience and universal adoption of smartphones. Through our design research, we discovered that common issues with our interface stemmed from a lack of both internal and external consistency. Our research also led us to narrow Tidy's focus to chore management specifically, as designs that included various additional household management features proved to be too cluttered and confusing for users to navigate. As a result, our final digital mockup represents a balance between the themes of minimalism, accessibility, and functionality.

Initial Paper Prototype
-----------------------

After deciding upon our smartphone application design, we began brainstorming ideas for our paper prototype. Our initial goal was lofty - to create a comprehensive household management application that offered all household-related functionalities, including chores, finances, scheduling, and messaging. The two tasks we chose to focus on were maintaining chore accountability and managing shared finances, so we concentrated on these aspects of in prototype.

The dashboard is the home screen of our interface. To view shared finances, the user navigates to the finance page through the bottom navigation bar.

<img src="webImage4.jpg" width="200" height="300"alt = "initial prototype - finances section" />  <img src="webImage5.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - tapping grocery category"/> 
In the finance page, participants are shown an overview of all shared expenses for the current calendar month. Participants can click on individual categories to view a detailed summary of expenses in that category.

<img src="webImage6.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - grocery category overview"/>  <img src="webImage7.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - exiting grocery overview"/> 
Participants can view how much money has been spent on groceries and which roommates the transaction is split between.

Participant sees that he/she owes a total of $764 and decides to reimburse his/her roommates.

<img src="webImage10.jpg" width="150" height="275" alt = "initial prototype - pay area"/>  <img src="webImage11.jpg" width="150" height="275"  alt = "initial prototype - tapping pay full"/> <img src="webImage12.jpg" width="150" height="275" alt = "initial prototype - full balance populates"/>  <img src="webImage14.jpg" width="150" height="275" alt = "initial prototype - confirming payment" /> <img src="webImage15.jpg" width="150" height="275"  alt = "initial prototype - updated finances section"/>
Participant taps "Pay Full" and confirms his/her decision to pay off all expenses. In the main finance screen, he/she can now see that the current balance is $0.

<img src="webImage16.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - finances section"/>  <img src="webImage17.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - adding new expense"/> 
Participant decides to add a new category of expenses.

<img src="webImage18.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - new expense page"/>  <img src="webImage19.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - tapping category input box" />
Participant fills out basic information regarding the new expense.

<img src="webImage20.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - keyboard pop up"/> <img src="webImage21.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - share expense w/ first roommate"/>  <img src="webImage22.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - share expense w/ second roommate"/>

<img src="webImage23.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - share expense w/ third roommate" /> <img src="webImage24.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - three roommates selected" /> <img src="webImage25.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - confirm new expense" />
User creates a new "take out" expense  and splits the cost with 3 roommates. 

### Task 2 - Maintaining Chore Accountability

<img src="webImage26.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - tapping chores section" />  <img src="webImage27.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - chore section"/> 
Tapping on the "Chores" tab of the navigation bar from the dashboard brings the participant to a chore overview page.

<img src="webImage28.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - increasing priority of garbage"/>  <img src="webImage29.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - chores rearrange based on priority"/> 
Users have the ability to tap on the priority button to increase the urgency of a chore. Chores are arranged by priority, with the highest priority chore on top. 

<img src="webImage30.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - tapping my chores"/>  <img src="webImage31.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - my chores"/> <img src="webImage32.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - tapping single chore"/>
The participant taps on the My Chores tab to view chores assigned to the specific participant and chore details. Participants tap on a chore to mark it as complete.

<img src="webImage33.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - picture viewfinder"/>  <img src="webImage34.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - taking a picture"/> 
Participants must capture an image of their completed chore.

<img src="webImage35.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - send to roommate prompt"/>  <img src="webImage36.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - photo confirmation"/>
Once the picture is taken, it is automatically sent to the participants roommates for confirmation. 

<img src="webImage37.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "initial prototype - chore marked as complete"/>  
Once a specified number of roommates have viewed the chore and confirmed that it is completed, the chore is marked as "complete" on the My Chore page.


Testing Process
---------------

### Heuristic Evaluation
A heuristic evaluation was held to identify any transparent issues in the design before any interactions with it take place. Because evaluators needed a general understanding of the issues to look out, our participants were limited to those familiar with the process (i.e. CSE 440 students). We began our tests by walking the participants through the general design flow and explained the basic functionalities supported by our design. The participants were then asked to evaluate the design based on a predetermined list of heuristics.

### Usability Tests
We conducted our first usability test with a current senior studying Aeronautics and Aerospace Engineering from the University of Washington at Odegaard Undergraduate Library, as it was an accessible location for the participant. He currently lives with his family, but has experience living with roommates.

Our second usability test was conducted in section with a fellow CSE 440 student. This student is a junior at the University of Washington and has experience in developing both user interfaces and paper prototypes. Both the participant and testing location were preset by the course staff.

Our third usability test participant is a current senior at the University of Washington who currently lives with six housemates in an off-campus house. Because this participant’s living situation matches our target demographic, it allowed us to gather direct insight as to whether our design is suitable for our user group. The test was conducted in Mary Gates Hall due to its accessibility and convenience for our participant.

Each usability test began with a brief introduction to the design and goals for the test. Participants were encouraged to share what they were thinking aloud during the execution of the tasks we set for them and following the test, debriefed with test overseers about any lingering thoughts or confusion they had about the current prototype.

### Testing Process Changes
For every iteration of our tests besides our initial heuristic evaluation, we produced a revised paper prototype based on results from the prior test. This allowed us to reduce the volume of similar insights we would gather from subsequent tests and enabled us to focus on a different set of tasks for the next test. In our first usability test, the person acting as the “computer” was not aware of all possible interactions with the paper prototype. To prevent confusion in later tests, we performed several practice runs with the latest revision of the prototype to ensure that the “computer” felt comfortable with all of the prototype’s functions. We also decided to rotate roles throughout the testing process in hopes of provoking new insights.


Testing Results and Prototype Refinement
----------------------------------------

During our heuristic evaluations, we discovered design flaws resulting from a lack of outside perspective during the creation of our initial design. One flaw we discovered was a failure to match our design to the real world. For example, the "chores" icon in the navigation bar was initially represented by a coat hanger. Our testing revealed that no one instinctively associates this icon with chores. We fixed this general issue by representing more sections of the interface using plain text and revising our navigation icons. A second issue that the heuristic evaluations revealed was a lack of internal consistency. In the pictures below, you can see a dollar sign and a check mark both being used to "confirm" similar tasks, which confused our participants. As a result, maintaining consistency became a focus of the remainder of the design process.

![chore confirmation icon inconsistencies](webImage38.png)

After our usability tests, we found that the scope of our project was too broad, which led our interface to be cluttered and unintuitive. Because we included various finance-related functionalities and basic messaging features on top of chore management, our participant's mental model of the app was heavily divided between different modes. We also realized that existing popular products such as Venmo and Facebook Messenger already offered these features, so we decided to shift Tidy's focus away from these areas.

Another issue we found related to the task of chore prioritization. While participants were typically able to successfully complete the task, most did not understand the significance of doing so. To address this problem, we emphasized the idea that chores were arranged based on priority and added a notification feature that sends push notifications to household members when their chore is "prioritized".

Another major problem we encountered was a failure to correctly set up our participant's mental model. Because the household creation and chore preference settings were back to back in the setup process, our participant was unable to distinguish between the purposes of the two tasks. Rather than setting his own personal preferences, our participant thought that he was setting household-wide preferences, making him the "household authority figure". This discrepancy between our design's perceived purpose and the intended purpose negatively influenced our participant's interaction with the design, even after the initial setup. To solve this problem, we clearly separated the two tasks by moving the chore preference selection to the user profile page, distinguishing it from the initial household setup process.

Another change we decided to make based on usability testing was the removal of the picture confirmation to mark a chore as completed. We received feedback that this feature felt like a burden on the usability of the design and would be completely unnecessary in a house with a basic foundation of trust. 

### Themes in Testing Results

One of the most difficult considerations regarding the participants' attention and time was the balance between functionality and tedium. Every effort to provide additional functionality came with some kind of cost in terms of the participants' time or attention. We found this to be a fundamental challenge - how do we provide useful user feedback while maintaining an intuitive user experience when interacting with the design? When deciding how to approach this problem, we ended up focusing on allowing the user to interact with it on their own terms.

The most notable theme across our testing results was what we entitled muddied mental models. Across all iterations of our prototypes, we struggled to set up mental models for our participants that accurately reflected the design's intended purpose. In our early tests, this was demonstrated by an over-division of the mental model from the wide range tasks that our prototype attempted to support. This was addressed by iteratively moving towards an emphasis on chore management, with clear navigation to guide users toward this focus. In later usability tests, an oversight in the chore preference setup process misled participants from the actual intended purpose. We struggled with this problem throughout the entire design process and worked tirelessly to ensure that Tidy's manifest model offered a clear and intentional purpose for future users.

Final Paper Prototype
---------------------

We understood that our final paper prototype would function as a guideline for the digital mockup. So, during the development of this final iteration we worked to implement a minimalist aesthetic to give ourselves more freedom to develop visual ideas in the mockup. Despite our minimalist focus, we were intentional about maintaining basic design elements that were in our original designs to ensure that that they would be carried over to the final product.

The chores on the chore page rearrange to show the most "reminded" chore on top.  John receives a push notification reminding him to complete the chore.

### Task 2: Chore Preference Consideration

<img src="webImage44.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "final prototype - tooltip prompt"/>  <img src="webImage45.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "final prototype - tapping on tooltip profile"/>
After joining a household, all participants are prompted by a tooltip to rank their chores preferences on the profile page. 

<img src="webImage46.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "final prototype - profile chore preferences"/>  <img src="webImage47.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt = "final prototype - all chores section"/>
From the profile page, participants drag and drop chores to adjust their preferences. The participant is brought back to the main chore page, where chores are automatically delegated as members join. 




Digital Mockup
---------------------

As we transitioned from our paper prototype to the digital mockup, we decided to change an aspect of the household setup process. We felt like our current solution for how users were inputting what types of chores were required in their household was not optimized. Previously users would have to type out each individual chore and the instructions to go along with it. However, while we were in the process of making our mockups we thought it would be better to let users select from a set of common chores with an option to add more chores if necessary. We did not get to user test this idea, but we believe it helps maximize the efficiency.

### Task 1 - Chore Preference Consideration

Kara is a new Tidy user and hopes that Tidy will help her and her roommates create a more organized system to distribute household duties. Upon opening Tidy for the first time, Kara decides to set up an account and create a household. After completing the initial setup, Kara can then set her personal chore preferences. From that point on, Tidy's algorithm will automatically assign chores to everyone in the household, taking into account chore preferences, completion rate, and assignment history.

After joining or creating a household, all members are prompted to rank household chores by their personal preference. Once preferences are saved, chores will be automatically assigned by the system and can be viewed on the "All Chores" page.

### Task 2 - Maintaining Chore Accountability

Kara and her roommates have all created accounts and set their chore preferences. Each roommate has been assigned a number of chores to complete, which everyone can monitor in the "All Chores" tab. Kara notices that one of her roommates has yet to complete the dishes and taps the prioritize button to politely remind her to do the dishes without needing to confront her face to face.

<img src="webImage60.png" width="200" height="400" alt = "digital mockup - all chores section"/>  
Kara notices that a roommate (Taylor) has not finished one of her chores (washing the dishes).

<img src="webImage61.png" width="200" height="400" alt = "digital mockup - chore is prioritized"/>  
Kara taps the "Prioritize" button next to the chore in question. The chores on the "All Chores" page rearrange to show the most "prioritized" chore on top.

<img src="webImage62.png" width="200" height="400" alt = "digital mockup - chore notification"/>  
Taylor receives a push notification on her phone reminding her to complete the chore.

<img src="webImage63.png" width="200" height="400" alt = "digital mockup - my chores section"/>  <img src="webImage64.png" width="200" height="400" alt = "digital mockup - chore marked as complete"/>
Taylor washes the dishes, navigates to the "My Chores" section, and marks the chore as completed.
